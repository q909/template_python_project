  abstract = {Urban energy use modeling is important for understanding and managing energy performance in cities. However, the existing methods and tools have limitations in representing a realistic urban energy model and supporting energy performance evaluation at urban or neighborhood scales. In addition, there is a lack of an integrated approach for modeling and analyzing different components of urban energy use. The existing methods and tools for assessment of urban energy use often reduce the urban energy use definition to operational energy of buildings, ignoring other essential components such as transportation energy, and embodied energy of buildings and infrastructure. In addition, reliable and accurate urban energy prediction remains a challenge as methodological uncertainties that are embedded in the common methods are often not considered. This, in turn, affects the suitability of these approaches for decision-making purposes. The key limitation of data-driven methods stem from the use of aggregate data for energy use estimations and generalizing the status quo. In simulation-based methods, oversimplification of the urban context and failure to account for occupancy and human-related factors, and urban microclimate and inter-building effects are the major limitations. The present article provides a review of the current modeling methods, tools, and techniques in urban energy use modeling. It examines the strengths and limitations of each and presents an outlook for a future urban energy use modeling (UEUM) approach that could capture different components of urban energy use through a bottom-up hybrid data-driven and simulation-based techniques to build upon the strengths of the two methods while reducing the modeling uncertainties.},

In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a e ciency and/or e ectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We speci cally examine the behavior of the commonly used Lk norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric (L2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the Lk norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can signi cantly improve the e ectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

  abstract = {The benefits of renewable energy are that it is sustainable and is low in environmental pollution. Growing load requirement, global warming, and energy crisis need energy-intensive management to give sincere attempts to promote high accuracy energy monitoring techniques in order to enhance energy system efficiency and performance. The energy consumption data of domestic, commercial and industrial are becoming accessible to estimate the notable share of various sectors in the energy market. Energy forecasting algorithms play a vital role in energy sector development and policy formulation. Energy prediction and power supply management are the key roots of energy planning. A large number of prediction models have been used in the recent past. The selection of a prediction model usually based on available data, the objectives of the model network mechanism and energy planning operation. In this review, we conduct a critical and systematic review of renewable energy and electricity prediction models applied as an energy planning tool. The forecasting intervals is divided into three sections including: i) short-term; ii) medium-term; iii) and long-term. Three renewable energy resources, i.e. wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and electricity load demand requirement are considered for review forecasting analysis. Three major states-of-art forecasting classifications: i) machine learning algorithms; ii) ensemble-based approaches; iii) and artificial neural networks are analyzed. These approaches are investigated for prediction applicability; accuracy for spatial and temporal forecasting; and relevance to policy and planning objectives. The machine learning models can handle large amount of data with accurate forecasting analysis. Applying ensemble techniques enables us to obtain higher forecasting accuracy by combining different models. Artificial neural networks if used in the right way can contribute a robust choice, given that it is capible to extract and model unseen relationships and features. Furthermore, unlike these conventional techniques, artificial neural networks do not force any limitation on residual and input distributions. Findings from this review would help professionals and researchers in obtaining recognition of the prediction approaches and allow them to choose the relevant methods to satisfy their desired tasks and forecasting requirements.},

  abstract = {Daily operations and planning in a smart grid require a day-ahead load forecasting of its customers. The accuracy of day-ahead load-forecasting models has a significant impact on many decisions such as scheduling of fuel purchases, system security assessment, economic scheduling of generating capacity, and planning for energy transactions. However, day-ahead load forecasting is a challenging task due to its dependence on external factors such as meteorological and exogenous variables. Furthermore, the existing day-ahead load-forecasting models enhance forecast accuracy by paying the cost of increased execution time. Aiming at improving the forecast accuracy while not paying the increased executions time cost, a hybrid artificial neural network-based day-ahead load-forecasting model for smart grids is proposed in this paper. The proposed forecasting model comprises three modules: (i) a pre-processing module; (ii) a forecast module; and (iii) an optimization module. In the first module, correlated lagged load data along with influential meteorological and exogenous variables are fed as inputs to a feature selection technique which removes irrelevant and/or redundant samples from the inputs. In the second module, a sigmoid function (activation) and a multivariate auto regressive algorithm (training) in the artificial neural network are used. The third module uses a heuristics-based optimization technique to minimize the forecast error. In the third module, our modified version of an enhanced differential evolution algorithm is used. The proposed method is validated via simulations where it is tested on the datasets of DAYTOWN (Ohio, USA) and EKPC (Kentucky, USA). In comparison to two existing day-ahead load-forecasting models, results show improved performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, execution time, and scalability.},

  abstract = {Due to environmental concerns, power system generation is shifting from traditional fossil-fuel resources to renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal. Some of these technologies are very location specific while others require high upfront costs. Photovoltaic (PV) generation has become the rising star of this pack, thanks to its versatility. It can be implemented with very little upfront costs, e.g., small solar home systems, or large solar power plants can be developed to generate MWs of power. In contrast with wind or tidal generation, PV can be deployed all around the globe, albeit with varying potentials. These merits have made PV the renewable energy technology with highest installed capacity around the globe. However, PV penetration into the grid comes with its drawbacks. The inverter-interfaced nature of the PV systems significantly impacts the power system operation from protection, power flow and stability perspectives. There must be strategies to mitigate these negative impacts so that PV penetration into the grid can continue. This paper gives a thorough overview of such strategies from different research fields: such as communication, artificial intelligence, power electronics and electric vehicle charging coordination. In addition, possible research directions are given for future work.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the AC power output of a PV plant accurately is important both for plant owners and electric system operators. Two main categories of PV modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper, a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology, and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE lower than 1.3\%.},

The objective is to cluster the data in such a way that building a forecasting models separately for each cluster and taking the sum of forecasts leads to a better accuracy than building one forecasting model for the total aggregate of all meters. To measure the similarity between time series, we consider wavelet feature extraction and several positive-definite kernels. To forecast the aggregated meter data, we use a periodic autoregressive model with calendar and temperature information as exogenous variable. The data used in the experiments are smart meter recordings from 6,000 residential customers and small-to-medium enterprises collected by the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The results show a 20\% improvement in forecasting accuracy, where the highest gain is obtained using a kernel with the Spearman's distance. The resulting clusters show distinctive patterns particularly during hours of peak demand.},

  abstract = {Large-scale deployment of advanced smart grid technologies bolsters load forecasting as a vital requirement for deregulated power systems. In this regard, providing an accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) can facilitate demand response applications and real-time electricity dispatch. STLF is mainly influenced by meteorological conditions among which investigating the relationship between temperature and household total electricity consumption is notably important due to their strong correlation. Accordingly, in this paper, we estimate the total electricity consumption to explore the impact of temperature in terms of a non-linear relationship with electricity demand. We propose the adaptive conditional density estimation (ACDE) method on the basis of kernel density estimation (KDE) to enhance the load forecast accuracy. The aim of the suggested approach is to decompose and examine the mentioned relationship in the context of both temperature-related, and residual components of the total consumption. The performance of the model to forecast the electricity demand is evaluated using a comparison study. The results prove that an ACDE model can significantly improve the recognition capability of the temperature-related component of aggregated power. Finally, the efficacy of the ACDE method is examined via numerical analysis of real data.},

Therefore, accurate predictions/forecasts of energy demands (loads) at individual site and aggregate level of the grid is crucial. Despite extensive research, load forecasting remains to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a load forecasting methodology based on deep learning. Specifically, the work presented in this paper investigates the effectiveness of using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for performing energy load forecasting at individual building level. The presented methodology uses convolutions on historical loads. The output from the convolutional operation is fed to fully connected layers together with other pertinent information. The presented methodology was implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption for a single residential customer. Results obtained from the CNN were compared against results obtained by Long Short Term Memories LSTM sequence-to-sequence (LSTM S2S), Factored Restricted Boltzmann Machines (FCRBM), ``shallow'' Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the same dataset. Experimental results showed that the CNN outperformed SVR while producing comparable results to the ANN and deep learning methodologies. Further testing is required to compare the performances of different deep learning architectures in load forecasting.},

Emerging smart grid technologies pose new challenges and opportunities. Although load forecasting at the aggregate level has been extensively studied, electrical load forecasting at fine-grained geographical scales of households is more challenging. Among existing approaches, semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAM) have been increasingly popular due to their accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. Their applicability is justified when forecasting is addressed at higher levels of aggregation, since the aggregated load pattern contains relatively smooth additive components. High resolution data are highly volatile, forecasting the average load using GAM models with smooth components does not provide meaningful information about the future demand. Instead, we need to incorporate irregular and volatile effects to enhance the forecast accuracy. We focus on the analysis of such hybrid additive models applied on smart meters data and show that it leads to improvement of the forecasting performances of classical additive models at low aggregation levels.},

More precisely, a new model is introduced in order to capture both the advantages of a semi-linear modelling and those of the recent advances on nonparametric statistics for functional data. The aim of this note is to provide the first advances in this direction. After having constructed precisely the so-called semi-functional partially linear model, the estimates are presented and some asymptotic results (with rates of convergence) are given. Lastly, a real data example illustrates the usefulness of the model.},

  abstract = {This paper is to provide practical options for prognostics so that beginners can select appropriate methods for their fields of application. To achieve this goal, several popular algorithms are first reviewed in the data-driven and physics-based prognostics methods. Each algorithm's attributes and pros and cons are analyzed in terms of model definition, model parameter estimation and ability to handle noise and bias in data. Fatigue crack growth examples are then used to illustrate the characteristics of different algorithms. In order to suggest a suitable algorithm, several studies are made based on the number of data sets, the level of noise and bias, availability of loading and physical models, and complexity of the damage growth behavior. Based on the study, it is concluded that the Gaussian process is easy and fast to implement, but works well only when the covariance function is properly defined. The neural network has the advantage in the case of large noise and complex models but only with many training data sets. The particle filter and Bayesian method are superior to the former methods because they are less affected by noise and model complexity, but work only when physical model and loading conditions are available.},

Our approach is to isolate the e{$\carriagereturn$}ect of external temperature on electricity consumption and apply a time-series autoregressive model to the remaining signal. The proposed profiles may be used for making personalized energy-saving recommendations, detecting outliers, and generating very large realistic data sets for testing the scalability of smart meter data management systems. Using predictive power as a metric for the accuracy of consumption profiles, we show, using a real data set of 1000 homes, that our approach results in improved root-mean-squared prediction error compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract = {The topic of energy efficiency applied to buildings represents one of the key aspects in today's international energy policies. Emissions reduction and the achievement of the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are becoming a fundamental concern in the work of engineers and technicians operating in the energy management field. Optimal energy management practices need to deal with uncertainties in generation and demand, hence the development of reliable forecasting methods is an important priority area of research in electric energy systems. This paper presents a load forecasting model and the way it was applied to a real case study, to forecast the electrical consumption of the Cellini medical clinic of Turin. The model can be easily integrated into a Building Management System or into a real time monitoring system. The load forecasting is performed through the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed multi-layer perceptron ANN, based on a back propagation training algorithm, is able to take as inputs: loads, data concerning the type of day (e.g. weekday/holiday), time of the day and weather data. In particular, this work focuses on providing a detailed analysis and an innovative formal procedure for the selection of all the ANN parameters.},

  abstract = {Demand response (DR) is one of the most promising ways to control peak energy demand in power networks that allows customers to make informed decisions regarding their energy consumption, and helps the energy providers reduce the peak load demand and reshape the load profile. Most of the existing DR strategies consider constant energy loads for devices in the system; however, energy load variation poses a major challenge to the feasibility of the solutions acquired by existing techniques. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary simulation optimization framework to implement an interruptive DR strategy on a smart grid with uncertain device loads. The proposed framework aims at adjusting the peak demand to the desired demand curve while ensuring the network reliability. This framework includes three components that interact and cooperate with each other: 1) a genetic algorithm that progressively improves the existing scenarios or discovers new scenarios for the interruption, 2) a simulation model that simulates the performance of selected scenarios, and 3) a design ranking algorithm that optimizes the allocation of simulation replications and identifies the top m best scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a simulated smart grid that includes 29 different types of devices. The results of the proposed framework are quite promising in terms of feasibility where it acquires at least 4 times as many feasible solutions as existing approaches do.},

Although the study of deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges.},

  abstract = {The advent of distributed renewable energy supply sources and storage systems has placed a greater degree of focus on the operations of the LV (low voltage) electricity distribution network. However, LV networks are characterised by having much higher variability in time series demand meaning that modelling techniques solely relying on iterative forecasts to produce a next day demand profile forecast are insufficient. To cater for the complexity of LV network demand, a novel hybrid expert system comprised of three modules, namely, correlation clustering, discrete classification neural network, and a post-processing procedure was developed. The system operates by classifying a set of key variables associated with a future day and refining a recalled historical demand profile as the forecast. The expert system exhibited high hindcast accuracy when trained with a residential LV transformer's demand data with R2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87 and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) ranging from 11\% to 12\% across the three phases of the network. Under simulated real world conditions the R2 statistic reduced slightly to 0.81\textendash 0.84 and the MAPE increased to 12.5\textendash 13.5\%. Future work will involve integrating the developed expert system for forecasting next day demand in an LV network into a comprehensive distributed energy resource management algorithm.},

Several approaches that deal with this complex problem have been proposed in the literature but an extensive comparison on a large number of tasks is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing existing strategies for multi-step ahead forecasting and comparing them in theoretical and practical terms. To attain such an objective, we performed a large scale comparison of these different strategies using a large experimental benchmark (namely the 111 series from the NN5 forecasting competition). In addition, we considered the effects of deseasonalization, input variable selection, and forecast combination on these strategies and on multi-step ahead forecasting at large. The following three findings appear to be consistently supported by the experimental results: Multiple-Output strategies are the best performing approaches, deseasonalization leads to uniformly improved forecast accuracy, and input selection is more effective when performed in conjunction with deseasonalization.},

  abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series' last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of crossvalidation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the ``best of both worlds'', we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.},

The advantage of using a blocked cross-validation scheme with respect to the standard out-of-sample procedure is that cross-validation yields more precise error estimates of the prediction error since it makes full use of the data. In order to quantify the gain in precision when directional accuracy measures are considered, a Monte Carlo analysis using univariate and multivariate models is provided. The experiments indicate that more precise estimates are obtained with the blocked cross-validation procedure. An application is carried out on forecasting UK interest rate for illustration purposes. The results show that in such a situation with small samples the crossvalidation scheme may have considerable advantages over the standard out-of-sample evaluation procedure as it may help to overcome problems induced by the limited information the directional accuracy measures contain due to their binary nature.},

However, many distance functions are known to suffer from poor contrast in high-dimensional settings, putting their usefulness as similarity measures into question. On the other hand, shared-nearest-neighbor distances based on the ranking of data objects induced by some primary distance measure have been known to lead to improved performance in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we study the performance of shared-neighbor similarity measures in the context of similarity search for time series data objects. Our findings are that the use of shared-neighbor similarity measures generally results in more stable performances than that of their associated primary distance measures.},

  abstract = {Modern installations have become sensitive to power quality (PQ) related problems because more sophisticated devices with non-linear operating characteristics are often used there. On the contrary, most of these devices produce emissions that could decrease the PQ level of the network. It is becoming an increasing problem for the network operators to maintain good voltage quality because of the interactions of customer's loads with the grid. It is anticipated that the network's physical characteristics (e.g. short circuit power, grid impedance) can influence the PQ performance (harmonic distortion, flicker severity) in the distribution grid. In this paper, a typical modern medium and low voltage Dutch grid is described that is modelled in the analysis tool `Power Factory'. The network is simulated to analyze grid impedance and short circuit powers at different parts of the network. Furthermore, the importance of grid impedance is analyzed in relation to PQ aspects at the customer's point of connection.},

  abstract = {Electricity demand shifting and reduction still raise a huge interest for end-users at the household level, especially because of the ongoing design of a dynamic pricing approach. In particular, end-users must act as the starting point for decreasing their consumption during peak hours to prevent the need to extend the grid and thus save considerable costs. This article points out the relevance of a fuzzy logic algorithm to efficiently predict short term load consumption (STLC). This approach is the cornerstone of a new home energy management (HEM) algorithm which is able to optimize the cost of electricity consumption, while smoothing the peak demand. The fuzzy logic modeling involves a strong reliance on a complete database of real consumption data from many instrumented show houses. The proposed HEM algorithm enables any end-user to manage his electricity consumption with a high degree of flexibility and transparency, and ``reshape'' the load profile. For example, this can be mainly achieved using smart control of a storage system coupled with remote management of the electric appliances. The simulation results demonstrate that an accurate prediction of STLC gives the possibility of achieving optimal planning and operation of the HEM system.},

  abstract = {Some of the challenges to predict energy utilization has gained recognition in the residential sector due to the significant energy consumption in recent decades. However, the modeling of residential building energy consumption is still underdeveloped for optimal and robust solutions while this research area has become of greater relevance with significant advances in computation and simulation. Such advances include the advent of artificial intelligence research in statistical model development. Artificial neural network has emerged as a key method to address the issue of nonlinearity of building energy data and the robust calculation of large and dynamic data. The development and validation of such models on one of the TxAIRE Research houses has been demonstrated in this paper. The TxAIRE houses have been designed to serve as realistic test facilities for demonstrating new technologies. The input variables used from the house data include number of days, outdoor temperature and solar radiation while the output variables are house and heat pump energy consumption. The models based on Levenberg-Marquardt and OWO-Newton algorithms had promising results of coefficients of determination within 0.87e0.91, which is comparable to prior literature. Further work will be explored to develop a robust model for residential building application.},

In both cases the modeling techniques which are used to implement these predictors are multi-input single-output techniques. This paper discusses the limits of single-output approaches when the predictor is expected to return a long series of future values and presents a multi-output approach to long term prediction. The motivation for this work is the fact that, when predicting multiple steps ahead of a time series, it could be interesting to exploit the information that a future series value could have on another future value. We propose a multi-output extension of our previous work on Lazy Learning, called LL-MIMO, and we introduce an averaging strategy of several long term predictors to improve the final accuracy. In order to show the effectiveness of the method, we present the results obtained on the three training time series of the ESTSP'08 competition.},

One of the most important issues which the designers of smart grids need to deal with is to forecast the fluctuations of power demand and generation in order to make the power system facilities more flexible to the variable nature of renewable power resources and demand-side. This paper proposes a novel two-tier scheme for forecasting the power demand and generation in a general residential electrical gird which uses the distributed renewable resources as the primary energy resource. The proposed forecasting scheme has two tiers: long-term demand/generation forecaster which is based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and real-time demand/generation forecaster which is based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA) model. The paper also shows that how bulk generation improves the adequacy of proposed residential system by canceling-out the forecasters estimation errors which are in the form of Gaussian White noises.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

  abstract = {Short-term load forecasting is crucial for the operations planning of an electrical grid. Forecasting the next 24 h of electrical load in a grid allows operators to plan and optimize their resources. The purpose of this study is to develop a more accurate short-term load forecasting method utilizing non-linear autoregressive artificial neural networks (ANN) with exogenous multi-variable input (NARX). The proposed implementation of the network is new: the neural network is trained in open-loop using actual load and weather data, and then, the network is placed in closed-loop to generate a forecast using the predicted load as the feedback input. Unlike the existing short-term load forecasting methods using ANNs, the proposed method uses its own output as the input in order to improve the accuracy, thus effectively implementing a feedback loop for the load, making it less dependent on external data. Using the proposed framework, mean absolute percent errors in the forecast in the order of 1\% have been achieved, which is a 30\% improvement on the average error using feedforward ANNs, ARMAX and state space methods, which can result in large savings by avoiding commissioning of unnecessary power plants. The New England electrical load data are used to train and validate the forecast prediction.},

  abstract = {Load forecasting problems have traditionally been addressed using various statistical methods, among which autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) has gained the most attention as a classical time-series modeling method. Recently, the booming development of deep learning techniques make them promising alternatives to conventional data-driven approaches. While deep learning offers exceptional capability in handling complex non-linear relationships, model complexity and computation efficiency are of concern. A few papers have explored the possibility of applying deep neural networks to forecast time-series load data but only limited to system-level or single-step building-level forecasting. This study, however, aims at filling in the knowledge gap of deep learning-based techniques for day-ahead multi-step load forecasting in commercial buildings. Two classical deep neural network models, namely recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), have been proposed and formulated under both recursive and direct multi-step manners. Their performances are compared with the Seasonal ARIMAX model with regard to accuracy, computational efficiency, generalizability and robustness. Among all of the investigated deep learning techniques, the gated 24h CNN model, performed in a direct multi-step manner, proves itself to have the best performance, improving the forecasting accuracy by 22.6\% compared to that of the seasonal ARIMAX.},

Aggregators manage their portfolio of resources in order to obtain the maximum benefit from the grid, while participating in the day-ahead wholesale electricity market. The goal of this paper is to propose a model for aggregated DER systems planning, considering its participation in the electricity market and its impact on the market price. The results are the optimal planning and management of DER systems, and the appropriate energy transactions for the aggregator in the wholesale day-ahead market according to the size of its aggregated resources. A price-maker approach based on representing the market competitors with residual demand curves is followed, and the impact on the price is assessed to help in the decision of using price-maker or price-taker approaches depending on the size of the aggregated resources. A deterministic programming problem with two case studies (the average scenario and the most likely scenario from the stochastic ones), and a stochastic one with a case study to account for the market uncertainty are described. For both models, market scenarios have been built from historical data of the Spanish system.},

Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have suggested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-ofsquares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},

This article gives an overview of the state-of-art of energy planning and forecasting approaches for aiding physical improvement strategies in the building sector. Unlike previous reviews, which have addressed mainly the strengths as well as weaknesses of some of the approaches while referring to some relevant examples from the literature, this article focuses on critically analysing more approaches namely; 2D GIS and 3DGIS (CityGML) based energy prediction approaches, based on their frequent intervention scale, applicability in the building life cycle, and conventional prediction process. This will be followed by unravelling the gaps and issues pertaining to the reviewed approaches. Finally, based on the identified problems, future research prospects are recommended.},

An artificial Neural Network Ensemble (NNE) is developed to predict 24 hour ahead photovoltaic generation, one hour ahead wind power generation and load demand. The proposed machine learning is characterized by enhanced learning model and generalization capability. The efficiency of the microgrid operation strongly depends on the battery scheduling process, which cannot be achieved through conventional optimization formulation. In this study, a fuzzy logic expert system is used for battery scheduling. The proposed approach can handle uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy environment of the overall microgrid operation and the uncertainty related to the forecasted parameters. The results shows considerable minimization on operation cost and emission level comparing to literature microgrid energy management approaches based on opportunity charging and heuristic flowchart battery management.},

Having a fast algorithm for measuring profile similarity improves the efficiency of tasks such as clustering of customers and cross-validation of forecasting methods using historical data.

  abstract = {Recent work introduced a novel time-permuting error measure for forecasts of half-hourly, household-level energy demand, designed to reward forecasts which predict extremes (spikes) in demand at approximately the right times, albeit perhaps slightly early or late. In many applications such as smart storage control, such forecasts are preferable to those that predict no spikes at all. Building on that idea, we make three contributions. First we introduce a probabilistic framework to estimate error distributions for actuals about forecasts, using the time-permuting error measure. The framework includes a variable discount for older, possibly less relevant data. Second we employ this framework to derive conditions to be satisfied by the optimal forecast under the time-permuting error measure. In turn this requires a mixture of discrete (non derivative) optimisation and calculus to condition forecasts on available historical observations. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by using it to forecast the daily energy demand profiles for a large number of domestic energy customers. In particular we illustrate how such customers might be classified according to the relative forecastability of their behaviour and the corresponding need for different amounts of history to achieve such forecasts.},

Advances in metering technology and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges. In particular, a clustering-based hybrid model is established in this paper to predict the day-ahead hourly electric demand in hotel buildings, which were initially classified as the non-stationary operated buildings (NOB) due to the irregular electric temporal features. Specifically, with multi-dimensional attributes of 100days considered by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, similar days and hours were extracted stepwise into several homogeneous groups. Afterwards, the online modified predictor was established by the combination of support vector regression (SVR) and wavelet decomposition, taking the corresponding training samples extracted by FCM as the input. Clustered results of similar days testified the clear identification of stationary subsequences (Group IV) and non-stationary subsequences (Group I). Based on the validation, it can be concluded that the introduction of days-clustering can always improve the accuracy of day-ahead prediction, while the recognition of similar hours is necessary only for non-stationary subsequences. Finally, this paper offers an online short-term prediction approach for model-based energy management, based on the limited and fluctuating historical records.},

  abstract = {Reliable and highly-generalized prediction models of short-term electric demand are urgently needed for the building sector, as the crucial basis of sophisticated building energy management. Advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges for modified approaches. With multi-resolution wavelet decomposition (MWD) as a preprocessing from the point of view of signal analysis, the hybrid support vector regression (SVR) model was applied in two case study buildings to predict the hourly electric demand intensity. Taking ten-dimensional parameters of 29 workdays as the training sample, this model was carried out in a mall and a hotel, the consumed electric demand sequences of which represented the stationary and non-stationary series respectively. By comparisons between the hybrid SVR and the pure SVR, results indicated that the introduction of MWD can always improve the predicting accuracy for the hotel, while it is not necessary for the mall. Specifically, the similar steady level around 0.65W/m2 of absolute error was obtained for the mall and the hotel buildings, when {$\epsilon$} was lower than 0.1. At the same time, the steady quantitative values of relative errors tended to be around 4\% and 6\% respectively for the hotel and the mall. Based on the limited historical readings, this paper offers an on-line prediction method of short-term electric demand, which is applicable for the further smart energy management.},

  abstract = {The quality of short-term electricity load forecasting is crucial to the operation and trading activities of market participants in an electricity market. In this paper, it is shown that a multiple equation time-series model, which is estimated by repeated application of ordinary least squares, has the potential to match or even outperform more complex nonlinear and nonparametric forecasting models. The key ingredient of the success of this simple model is the effective use of lagged information by allowing for interaction between seasonal patterns and intra-day dependencies. Although the model is built using data for the Queensland region of Australia, the methods are completely generic and applicable to any load forecasting problem. The model's forecasting ability is assessed by means of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). For day-ahead forecast, the MAPE returned by the model over a period of 11 years is an impressive 1.36\%. The forecast accuracy of the model is compared with a number of benchmarks including three popular alternatives and one industrial standard reported by the Australia energy market operator (AEMO). The performance of the model developed in this paper is superior to all benchmarks and outperforms the AEMO forecasts by about a third in terms of the MAPE criterion.},

  abstract = {In the era of ``big data'', analysts usually explore various statistical models or machine learning methods for observed data in order to facilitate scientific discoveries or gain predictive power. Whatever data and fitting procedures are employed, a crucial step is to select the most appropriate model or method from a set of candidates. Model selection is a key ingredient in data analysis for reliable and reproducible statistical inference or prediction, and thus central to scientific studies in fields such as ecology, economics, engineering, finance, political science, biology, and epidemiology. There has been a long history of model selection techniques that arise from researches in statistics, information theory, and signal processing. A considerable number of methods have been proposed, following different philosophies and exhibiting varying performances. The purpose of this article is to bring a comprehensive overview of them, in terms of their motivation, large sample performance, and applicability. We provide integrated and practically relevant discussions on theoretical properties of state-ofthe-art model selection approaches. We also share our thoughts on some controversial views on the practice of model selection.},

The paper describes the design of a class of machine-learning models, namely neural networks, for the load forecasts of medium-voltage/low-voltage substations. We focus on the methodology of neural network model design in order to obtain a model that has the best achievable predictive ability given the available data. Variable selection and model selection are applied to electrical load forecasts to ensure an optimal generalization capacity of the neural network model. Real measurements collected in French distribution systems are used to validate our study. The results show that the neural network-based models outperform the time series models and that the design methodology guarantees the best generalization ability of the neural network model for the load forecasting purpose based on the same data.},

The decision-making system is a validated neural network, trained with optimized data, which can be used in any household metting certain conditions \textendash{} specific location and electricity tarrif, and consumption profile like to the standard verified by the local electricity utility. To validate this methodology, it was created three consumption and three solar generation profiles, which were combined to each other.

An analysis of the smart grid development in Brazil is performed, presenting the policy and regulation efforts beyond investments. This analysis takes account a pattern for smart grid development, and one may observe that Brazil is going towards a smart grid full implementation; however it could take decades and requires adjusts from govern, regulatory agency, utilities and consumers, and more investments. Moreover, some of the major smart grid projects in Brazil are presented, and their characteristics are compared considering the technologies used, location and electric utility goals. Depending on the electric utilities objectives, one may observe similarities and differences between concepts adopted and location of the Brazilian smart grid pilot projects. The first objective is the validation and replicability of the pilot project implemented; once, the project location is a sample of the utility's energy market or it is a particular area of interest, like an off-grid powered island with high environmental restrictions, for instance. The second objective is creating a model of sustainable smart grid with national visibility, once the project location is a touristic place. The conception of smart grid is aligned with sustainability, and it is a tendency in Brazil a massive entry of smart grid technologies in the next years.},

The problem is tackled using a nonparametric kernel approach, which has been recently adapted to this functional context. We derive theoretical results from a deep asymptotic analysis of the behaviour of the estimate, including mean squared convergence (with rates and precise evaluation of the constant terms) as well as asymptotic distribution. Practical use of these results relies on the ability to estimate these constants. Some perspectives in this direction are discussed. In particular, a functional version of wild bootstrapping ideas is proposed and used both on simulated and real functional datasets.},

  abstract = {Many forecasting models are built on neural networks. The key issues in these models, which strongly translate into the accuracy of forecasts, are data representation and the decomposition of the forecasting problem. In this work, we consider both of these problems using short-term electricity load demand forecasting as an example. A load time series expresses both the trend and multiple seasonal cycles. To deal with multi-seasonality, we consider four methods of the problem decomposition. Depending on the decomposition degree, the problem is split into local subproblems which are modeled using neural networks. We move from the global model, which is competent for all forecasting tasks, through the local models competent for the subproblems, to the models built individually for each forecasting task. Additionally, we consider different ways of the input data encoding and analyze the impact of the data representation on the results. The forecasting models are examined on the real power system data from four European countries. Results indicate that the local approaches can significantly improve the accuracy of load forecasting, compared to the global approach. A greater degree of decomposition leads to the greater reduction in forecast errors.},

We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings. However, our additional results show that these methods perform poorly on residential data, and that Least Squares Support Vector Machines perform best \textendash{} a technique not previously applied to this domain.},

  abstract = {In this study, the main objective is to predict buildings energy needs benefitting from orientation, insulation thickness and transparency ratio by using artificial neural networks. A backpropagation neural network has been preferred and the data have been presented to network by being normalized. The numerical applications were carried out with finite difference approach for brick walls with and without insulation of transient state one-dimensional heat conduction. Three different building samples with different form factors (FF) were selected. For each building samples 0\textendash 2.5\textendash 5\textendash 10\textendash 15cm insulations are assumed to be applied. Orientation angles of the samples varied from 0\textdegree{} to 80\textdegree{} and the transparency ratios were chosen as 15\textendash 20\textendash 25\%. A computer program written in FORTRAN was used for the calculations of energy demand and ANN toolbox of MATLAB is used for predictions. As a conclusion; when the calculated values compared with the outputs of the network, it is proven that ANN gives satisfactory results with deviation of 3.43\% and successful prediction rate of 94.8\textendash 98.5\%.},

  abstract = {Due to the current high energy prices it is essential to find ways to take advantage of new energy resources and enable consumers to better understand their load curve. This understanding will help to improve customer flexibility and their ability to respond to price or other signals from the electricity market. In this scenario, one of the most important steps is to carry out an accurate calculation of the expected consumption curve, i.e. the baseline. Subsequently, with a proper baseline, customers can participate in demand response programs and verify performed actions. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) method for short-term prediction of total power consumption in buildings with several independent processes. This problem has been widely discussed in recent literature but a new point of view is proposed. The method is based on two fundamental features: total consumption forecast based on independent processes of the considered load or end-uses; and an adequate selection of the training data set in order to simplify the ANN architecture. Validation of the method has been performed with the prediction of the whole consumption expressed as 96 active energy quarter-hourly values of the Universitat Polit\`ecnica de Val\`encia, a commercial customer consuming 11,500 kW.},

  abstract = {Smart grids are robust, self-healing networks that allow bidirectional propagation of energy and information within the utility grid. This introduces a new type of energy user who consumes, produces, stores and shares energy with other grid users. Such a user is called a ``prosumer.'' Prosumers' participation in the smart grid is critical for the sustainability and long-term efficiency of the energy sharing process. Thus, prosumer management has attracted increasing attention among researchers in recent years. This paper systematically examines the literature on prosumer community based smart grid by reviewing relevant literature published from 2009 to 2018 in reputed energy and technology journals. We specifically focus on two dimensions namely prosumer community groups and prosumer relationships. Based on the evaluated literature, we present eight propositions and thoroughly describe several future research directions.},

Firstly, outlier detection, which merges feature extraction, clustering analysis, and the generalized extreme studentized deviate (GESD), is performed to remove the abnormal daily energy consumption profiles. Secondly, the recursive feature elimination (RFE), an embedded variable selection method, is applied to select the optimal inputs to the base prediction models developed separately using eight popular predictive algorithms. The parameters of each model are then obtained through leave-group-out cross validation (LGOCV). Finally, the ensemble model is developed and the weights of the eight predictive models are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA).},

  abstract = {Modern apparatuses allow us to collect samples of functional data, mainly curves but also images. On the other hand, nonparametric statistics produces useful tools for standard data exploration. This book links these two fields of modern statistics by explaining how functional data can be studied through parameter-free statistical ideas. This book starts from theoretical foundations including functional nonparametric modeling, description of the mathematical framework, construction of the statistical methods, and statements of their asymptotic behaviors. It proceeds to computational issues including R and S-PLUS routines. Several functional datasets in chemometrics, econometrics, and pattern recognition are used to emphasize the wide scope of nonparametric functional data analysis in applied sciences. The companion Web site includes R and S-PLUS routines, command lines for reproducing examples presented in the book, and the functional datasets. Rather than set application against theory, this book is really an interface of these two features of statistics. A special effort has been made in writing this book to accommodate several levels of reading. The computational aspects are oriented toward practitioners whereas open problems emerging from this new field of statistics will attract Ph. D. students and academic researchers. Finally, this book is also accessible to graduate students starting in the area of functional statistics. Fr\'ed\'eric Ferraty and Philippe Vieu are both researchers in statistics at Toulouse University (France). They are co-founders and co-organizers of the working group STAPH which acquired an international reputation for functional and operatorial statistics. They are authors of many international publications in nonparametric inference as well as functional data analysis. Their scientific works are based on extensive collaborations both with academic statisticians and with scientists from other areas. They have been invited to organize special sessions on functional data in recent international conferences and to teach Ph. D. courses in various countries.},

For such a functional nonparametric regression model we introduce and study both practical and theoretical aspects of some kernel type estimator. After a simulation study, it is shown how this procedure is well adapted to some spectrometric data set. Asymptotic results are described and in conclusion it turns out that this method combines advantages of easy implementation and good mathematical properties.},

The problem is tackled using a nonparametric kernel approach, which has been recently adapted to this functional context. We derive theoretical results from a deep asymptotic analysis of the behaviour of the estimate, including mean squared convergence (with rates and precise evaluation of the constant terms) as well as asymptotic distribution. Practical use of these results relies on the ability to estimate these constants. Some perspectives in this direction are discussed. In particular, a functional version of wild bootstrapping ideas is proposed and used both on simulated and real functional datasets.},

  abstract = {In the European Union, the building sector is one of the largest energy consumer with about 40\% of the final energy consumption. Reducing consumption is also a sociological, technological and scientific matter. New methods have to be devised in order to support building professionals in their effort to optimize designs and to enhance energy performances. Indeed, the research field related to building modelling and energy performances prediction is very productive, involving various scientific domains. Among them, one can distinguish physics-related fields, focusing on the resolution of equations simulating building thermal behaviour and mathematics-related ones, consisting in the implementation of prediction model thanks to machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a detailed review and discussion of these works. First, the approaches based on physical (``white box'') models are reviewed according three-category classification. Then, we present the main machine learning (``black box'') tools used for prediction of energy consumption, heating/cooling demand, indoor temperature. Eventually, a third approach called hybrid (``grey box'') method is introduced, which uses both physical and statistical techniques. The paper covers a wide range of research works, giving the base principles of each technique and numerous illustrative examples.},

  abstract = {The k-assignment problem (or, the k-matching problem) on k-partite graphs is an NP-hard problem for k {$\geq$} 3. In this paper we introduce five new heuristics. Two algorithms, Bm and Cm, arise as natural improvements of Algorithm Am from (He et al., in: Graph Algorithms And Applications 2, World Scientific, 2004). The other three algorithms, Dm, Em, and Fm, incorporate randomization. Algorithm Dm can be considered as a greedy version of Bm, whereas Em and Fm are versions of local search algorithm, specialized for the k-matching problem. The algorithms are implemented in Python and are run on three datasets. On the datasets available, all the algorithms clearly outperform Algorithm Am in terms of solution quality. On the first dataset with known optimal values the average relative error ranges from 1.47\% over optimum (algorithm Am) to 0.08\% over optimum (algorithm Em). On the second dataset with known optimal values the average relative error ranges from 4.41\% over optimum (algorithm Am) to 0.45\% over optimum (algorithm Fm). Better quality of solutions demands higher computation times, thus the new algorithms provide a good compromise between quality of solutions and computation time.},

  abstract = {Recently, some nonparametric regression ideas have been extended to the case of functional regression. Within that framework, the main concern arises from the infinite dimensional nature of the explanatory objects. Specifically, in the classical multivariate regression context, it is well-known that any nonparametric method is affected by the socalled ``curse of dimensionality'', caused by the sparsity of data in highdimensional spaces, resulting in a decrease in fastest achievable rates of convergence of regression function estimators toward their target curve as the dimension of the regressor vector increases. Therefore, it is not surprising to find dramatically bad theoretical properties for the nonparametric functional regression estimators, leading many authors to condemn the methodology. Nevertheless, a closer look at the meaning of the functional data under study and on the conclusions that the statistician would like to draw from it allows to consider the problem from another point-of-view, and to justify the use of slightly modified estimators. In most cases, it can be entirely legitimate to measure the proximity between two elements of the infinite dimensional functional space via a semi-metric, which could prevent those estimators suffering from what we will call the ``curse of infinite dimensionality''.},

  abstract = {The importance of energy demand management has been more vital in recent decades as the resources are getting less, emission is getting more and developments in applying renewable and clean energies has not been globally applied. Demand forecasting plays a vital role in energy supply-demand management for both governments and private companies. Therefore, using models to accurately forecast the future energy consumption trends\textemdash specifically with nonlinear data\textemdash is an important issue for the power production and distribution systems. Several techniques have been developed over the last few decades to accurately predict the future in energy consumption. This paper reviews various energy demand-forecasting methods that have been published as research articles between 2005 and 2015. The scope of forecasting applications and techniques is quite large, and this article focuses on the methods which are used to predict energy consumption. The applications of traditional techniques such as econometric and time series models along with soft computing methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic and other models are reviewed in the current work. The most cited studies applied neural networks to forecast the energy consumption and approved the notable performance of the models, but computation time is much more than many other methods based on its sophisticated structure. Another field of future research includes the development of hybrid methods. The literature shows that the classical methods cannot result in dominant outputs anymore.},

  abstract = {High share of energy consumption in buildings and subsequent increase in greenhouse gas emissions along with stricter legislations have motivated researchers to look for sustainable solutions in order to reduce energy consumption by using alternative renewable energy resources and improving the efficiency in this sector. Today, the smart building and socially resilient city concepts have been introduced where building automation tech\- nologies are implemented to manage and control the energy generation/consumption/storage. Building auto\- mation and control systems can be roughly classified into traditional and advanced control strategies. Traditional strategies are not a viable choice for more sophisticated features required in smart buildings. The main focus of this paper is to review advanced control strategies and their impact on buildings and technical systems with respect to energy/cost saving. These strategies should be predictive/responsive/adaptive against weather, user, grid and thermal mass. In this context, special attention is paid to model predictive control and adaptive control strategies. Although model predictive control is the most common type used in buildings, it is not well suited for systems consisting of uncertainties and unpredictable data. Thus, adaptive predictive control strategies are being developed to address these shortcomings. Despite great progress in this field, the quantified results of these strategies reported in literature showed a high level of inconsistency. This is due to the application of different control modes, various boundary conditions, hypotheses, fields of application, and type of energy consumption in different studies. Thus, this review assesses the implementations and configurations of advanced control solu\- tions and highlights research gaps in this field that need further investigations.},

  abstract = {Distribution network operators (DNOs) are increasingly concerned about the impact of low carbon technologies on the low voltage (LV) networks. More advanced metering infrastructures provide numerous opportunities for more accurate load flow analysis of the LV networks. However, such data may not be readily available for DNOs and in any case is likely to be expensive. Modelling tools are required which can provide realistic, yet accurate, load profiles as input for a network modelling tool, without needing access to large amounts of monitored customer data. In this paper we outline some simple methods for accurately modelling a large number of unmonitored residential customers at the LV level. We do this by a process we call buddying, which models unmonitored customers by assigning them load profiles from a limited sample of monitored customers who have smart meters. Hence the presented method requires access to only a relatively small amount of domestic customers' data. The method is efficiently optimised using a genetic algorithm to minimise a weighted cost function between matching the substation data and the individual mean daily demands. Hence we can show the effectiveness of substation monitoring in LV network modelling. Using real LV network modelling, we show that our methods perform significantly better than a comparative Monte Carlo approach, and provide a description of the peak demand behaviour.},

The operator seeks to minimize the smart grid operational cost and offers rewards to aggregators toward this goal. Profit-maximizing aggregators compete to sell DR services to the operator and provide compensation to endusers in order to modify their preferable consumption pattern. Finally, end-users seek to optimize the tradeoff between earnings received from the aggregator and discomfort from having to modify their pattern.},

Our paper presents this methodology and illustrates its behaviour both on simulated and real curves datasets. It appears, from an example of interest in spectrometry, that the method provides a nice exploratory tool both for analyzing structural changes in the spectrum and for visualizing the most informative directions, still keeping good predictive power. Even if the main objective of this work is to discuss applied issues of the method, asymptotic behaviour is shortly described.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of measure phenomena were discovered as the mathematical background to statistical mechanics at the end of the nineteenth/beginning of the twentieth century and have been explored in mathematics ever since. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it became clear that the proper utilization of these phenomena in machine learning might transform the               curse of dimensionality               into the               blessing of dimensionality               . This paper summarizes recently discovered phenomena of measure concentration which drastically simplify some machine learning problems in high dimension, and allow us to correct legacy artificial intelligence systems. The classical concentration of measure theorems state that i.i.d. random points are concentrated in a thin layer near a surface (a sphere or equators of a sphere, an average or median-level set of energy or another Lipschitz function, etc.). The new               stochastic separation theorems               describe the thin structure of these thin layers: the random points are not only concentrated in a thin layer but are all linearly separable from the rest of the set, even for exponentially large random sets. The linear functionals for separation of points can be selected in the form of the linear Fisher's discriminant. All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction requires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples corresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier. The stochastic separation theorems provide us with such classifiers and determine a non-iterative (one-shot) procedure for their construction.                          This article is part of the theme issue `Hilbert's sixth problem'.},

The well-known phenomenon of the ``curse of dimensionality'' states: many problems become exponentially difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the ``blessing of dimensionality'', has attracted much attention. It turns out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces. Here we present a brief explanatory review of recent ideas, results and hypotheses about the blessing of dimensionality and related simplifying effects relevant to machine learning and neuroscience.},

They are required for optimising a wide range of potential network solutions on the low voltage (LV) grid, including the integration of low carbon technologies (such as photovoltaics) and the utilisation of battery storage devices. Despite the need for accurate LV level load forecasts, much of the literature has focused on the individual household or building level using data from smart meters, or on aggregates of such data. This study provides a detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for both point and probabilistic LV load forecasts. We evaluate the out-of-sample forecast accuracies of these methodologies on 100 real LV feeders, for horizons from one to four days ahead. In addition, we also test the effect of the temperature (both actual and forecast) on the accuracy of load forecasts. We present some important results on the drivers of forecasts accuracy as well as on the empirical comparison of point and probabilistic forecast measures.},

A common assumption in supervised learning is that the training input points follow the same probability distribution as the test input points. However, this assumption is not satisfied, for example, when outside of the training region is extrapolated. The situation where the training and test input points follow different distributions while the conditional distribution of output values given input points is unchanged is called covariate shift. Since almost all existing learning methods assume that the training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution, their fundamental theoretical properties such as consistency or efficiency no longer hold under covariate shift. In this chapter, we review recently proposed techniques for covariate shift adaptation.},

Such GDF can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the effective number of parameters in machine-learning approaches and thus compute informationtheoretical measures of fit. We compare GDF with cross-validation and find that the latter provides a less computer-intensive and more robust alternative. For Bernoulli-distributed data, GDF estimates were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously. Cross-validation, in contrast, performs well also for binary data, and for very different machine-learning approaches.},

In this work, we evaluate smart meter energy consumption data from homes and use autocorrelation to establish decisive parameters for GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based resursive Deep Learning. We demonstrate better short-term forecasting results for inhome energy consumption using our model.},

As recent results show, however, the problem is a very di cult one, not only with regards to the performance issue but also to the quality issue. In this paper, we discuss the quality issue and identify a new generalized notion of nearest neighbor search as the relevant problem in high dimensional space. In contrast to previous approaches, our new notion of nearest neighbor search does not treat all dimensions equally but uses a quality criterion to select relevant dimensions (projections) with respect to the given query. As an example for a useful quality criterion, we rate how well the data is clustered around the query point within the selected projection. We then propose an e cient and e ective algorithm to solve the generalized nearest neighbor problem. Our experiments based on a number of real and synthetic data sets show that our new approach provides new insights into the nature of nearest neighbor search on high dimensional data.},

The effects of the so-called `curse of dimensionality' have been studied by researchers for data sets generated according to a single data distribution. In this paper, we study the effects of this phenomenon on different similarity measures for multiplydistributed data. In particular, we assess the performance of sharedneighbor similarity measures, which are secondary similarity measures based on the rankings of data objects induced by some primary distance measure. We find that rank-based similarity measures can result in more stable performance than their associated primary distance measures.},

  abstract = {The very short-term load forecasting problem (VSTLF) is of particular interest for use in smart grid and automated demand response applications. An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day. This study was concerned with solving the VSTLF for individual households in Taiwan. The proposed approach obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.23\% and 2.44\% for forecasting individual household load and aggregation load 30 minutes ahead, respectively, which is more favorable than other methods do.},

Predicting electricity consumption at such very low scales should help to increase the efficiency of distribution networks and energy pricing. However, this is by no means a trivial task since household-level consumption is much more irregular than at the transmission or distribution levels. In this work, we address the problem of improving consumption forecasting by using the statistical relations between consumption series. This is done both at the household and district scales (hundreds of houses), using various machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine for regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). First, we determine which algorithm is best adapted to each scale, then, we try to find leaders among the time series, to help shortterm forecasting. We also improve the forecasting for district consumption by clustering houses according to their consumption profiles.},

  abstract = {Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) monitor and control the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) of buildings in addition to many other building systems and utilities. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have become the integral part of BEMS at the initial implementation phase or latter when retro fitting is required to upgrade older buildings. WSN enabled BEMS however have several challenges which are managing data, controllers, actuators, intelligence, and power usage of wireless components (which might be battery powered). The wireless sensor nodes have limited processing power and memory for embedding intelligence in the sensor nodes. In this work, we present a random neural network (RNN) based smart controller on a Internet of Things (IoT) platform integrated with cloud processing for training the RNN which has been implemented and tested in an environment chamber. The IoT platform is modular and not limited to but has several sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, inlet air coming from the HVAC duct and PIR. The smart RNN controller has three main components:base station, sensor nodes, and the cloud with embedded intelligence on each component for different tasks. This IoT platform is integrated with cloud processing for training the RNN. The RNN based occupancy estimator is embedded in sensor node which estimates the number of occupants inside the room and sends this information to the base station. The base station is embedded with RNN models to control the HVAC on the basis of setpoints for heating and cooling. The HVAC of the environment chamber consumes 27.12\% less energy with smart controller as compared to simple rule based controllers. The occupancy estimation time is reduced by our proposed hybrid algorithm for occupancy estimation that combines RNN based occupancy estimator with door sensor node (equipped with PIR and magnetic reed switch). The results show that accuracy of hybrid RNN occupancy estimator is 88\%.},

Their main function is to assist power systems during peak demand hours and also during contingencies. They are a subcategory of the family of demand side management (DSM) strategies. DR programs are classified into two broad categories; price-based DR programs and incentive-based DR programs. In order to exploit their full potential, DR programs must be implemented optimally. Such a problem, which here is referred to as ``DR optimisation problem'', is a hot research topic and has been frequently researched in the literature. This paper aims to review different research works on DR optimisation problems. Based on the conducted review, some directions for future research are proposed.},

  abstract = {Learning in the presence of a large number of irrelevant features is an important problem in high-dimensional tasks. Previous studies have shown that L1-norm regularization can be effective in such cases while L2-norm regularization is not. Furthermore, work in compressed sensing suggests that regularization by nonconvex (e.g., fractional) semi-norms may outperform L1-regularization. However, for classification it is largely unclear when this may or may not be the case. In addition, the nonconvex problem is harder to solve than the convex L1 problem. In this paper, we provide a more in-depth analysis to elucidate the potential advantages and pitfalls of nonconvex regularization in the context of logistic regression where the regularization term employs the family of Lq semi-norms. First, using results from the phenomenon of concentration of norms and distances in high dimensions, we gain intuition about the working of sparse estimation when the dimensionality is very high. Second, using the probably approximately correct (PAC)Bayes methodology, we give a data-dependent bound on the generalization error of Lq-regularized logistic regression, which is applicable to any algorithm that implements this model, and may be used to predict its generalization behavior from the training set alone. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by experiments and applications, where the PAC-Bayes bound is used to guide the choice of semi-norm in the regularization term. The results support the conclusion that the optimal choice of regularization depends on the relative fraction of relevant versus irrelevant features, and a fractional norm with a small exponent is most suitable when the fraction of relevant features is very small.},

Real Time Pricing (RTP), Time of Use (ToU) and Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) are discussed in detail. Two major categories of LF: mathematical and artificial intelligence based computational models are elaborated with subcategories. Mathematical models including auto recursive, moving average, auto recursive moving average, auto recursive integrated moving average, exponential smoothing, iterative reweighted mean square, multiple regression, etc. used for effective DSM are discussed.

The models are used to forecast future household energy demand considering different scenarios for the growth rates of the effective factors in the models. The household sector includes all energy-consuming activities in residential units (both apartments and houses) including space and water heating, cooling, lighting and the use of appliances. In order to understand the evolution of household energy use, a set of indicators has been developed. For instance, several factors affect energy consumption for space heating as a share of households' energy demand. These factors include, dwelling size, number of occupants, the efficiency of heating equipment and the useful energy intensity. The paper also analyzes the trend of energy consumption in the residential sector of the United States. Moreover, the effects of important indicators on the energy consumption are discussed. The analysis performed in this paper is done for each census region, where possible, to elucidate the effects of different indicators in each region.},

However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.},

Since electricity is consumed simultaneously as it is generated at the power plant, it is important to accurately predict the energy consumption in advance for stable power supply. In this paper, we propose a CNN-LSTM neural network that can extract spatial and temporal features to effectively predict the housing energy consumption. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM neural network, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), can extract complex features of energy consumption. The CNN layer can extract the features between several variables affecting energy consumption, and the LSTM layer is appropriate for modeling temporal information of irregular trends in time series components. The proposed CNN-LSTM method achieves almost perfect prediction performance for electric energy consumption that was previously difficult to predict. Also, it records the smallest value of root mean square error compared to the conventional forecasting methods for the dataset on individual household power consumption. The empirical analysis of the variables confirms what affects to forecast the power consumption most.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {As the power system is facing a transition towards a more intelligent, flexible and interactive system with higher penetration of renewable energy generation, load forecasting, especially short-term load forecasting for individual electric customers plays an increasingly essential role in the future grid planning and operation. Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.},

  abstract = {Two critical issue in the back-propagation (BP) learning are the discrimination capability given a number of hidden units and the speed of convergence in learning. The number of hidden units must be sufficient to provide the discriminating capability required by the given application. On the other hand, the training of an excessively large number of synaptic weights may be computationally costly and unreliable. This makes it desirable to have an apriori estimate of an optimal number of hidden neurons. Another closely related issue is the learning rate of the BP rule. In general, it is deairrblc to have a fast learning, but not so fast as incurring instability of the iterative computation. Breed on this principle should an optimal learning rate be determined. The algebraic projection (AP) analysis proposed in this paper provides an analytical solution to both of the problems. If the training patterns are completely irregular then the predicted optimal number of hidden neurons is the same as that of the training patterns. In the case of regularity embedded patterns, the number of hidden neurons will be very much dependent on the type of regularity inherent. Briefly, it influences an effective dimension of the subspace spanned by the activation values of the hidden layer, which in turn determines the optimal number of hidden neurons. Based on the AP analysis, the optimal learning rate parameter is found to be inversely proportional to the number of hidden neurons. More significantly,the parameter exhibits an inversely proportional relationship with the first derivative of the activation function, as opposed to the linear proportionality adopted in the conventional BP learning. The simulation results, which support the optimal hidden units size and learning rate as theoretically predicted by the AP analysis, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in information and communications technology (ICT) have initiated development of a smart electrical grid and smart buildings. Buildings consume a large portion of the total electricity production worldwide, and to fully develop a smart grid they must be integrated with that grid. Buildings can now be `prosumers' on the grid (both producers and consumers), and the continued growth of distributed renewable energy generation is raising new challenges in terms of grid stability over various time scales. Buildings can contribute to grid stability by managing their overall electrical demand in response to current conditions. Facility managers must balance demand response requests by grid operators with energy needed to maintain smooth building operations. For example, maintaining thermal comfort within an occupied building requires energy and, thus an optimized solution balancing energy use with indoor environmental quality (adequate thermal comfort, lighting, etc.) is needed. Successful integration of buildings and their systems with the grid also requires interoperable data exchange. However, the adoption and integration of newer control and communication technologies into buildings can be problematic with older legacy HVAC and building control systems. Public policy and economic structures have not kept up with the technical developments that have given rise to the budding smart grid, and further developments are needed in both technical and non-technical areas.},

Predominantly, heating and cooling in a building as well as the availability of solar and wind energy are directly affected by variables such as temperature, humidity and solar radiation. This makes energy management decision making and planning sensitive to the prevalent and future weather conditions. Research attempts are being made using a variety of statistical or physical algorithms to predict the evolution of the building load or generation in order to optimise the building energy management. The response of the building energy system to changes in weather conditions is inherently challenging to predict; nevertheless numerous methods in the literature describe and utilise weather predictions. Such methods are being reviewed in this study and their strengths, weaknesses and applications in commercial buildings at different prediction horizons are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of considering weather forecasting inputs in energy management systems is established by highlighting the dependencies of various building components on weather conditions. The issues of the difficulty in implementation of integrated weather forecasts at commercial building level and the potential added value through energy management optimisation are also addressed. Finally, a novel framework is proposed that utilises a range of weather variable predictions in order to optimise certain commercial building systems.},

Such concerns are particularly relevant as the UK moves towards a low carbon economy, and the electrification of heating and transport. Furthermore, small to medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute a significant proportion to network demand but are often overlooked. The smart meter roll out will provide greater visibility of the network, but such data may not be readily available to the DNOs. The question arises whether useful information about customer demand can be discerned from limited access to smart meter data? We analyse smart meter data from 196 SMEs so that one may create an energy demand profile based on information which is available without a smart meter. The profile itself comprises of simply two estimates, one for operational power and another for non-operational power. We further improve the profile by clustering the SMEs using a simple Gaussian mixture model. In both cases, the average difference between the actual and predicted operational/non-operational power is less than 0.15kWh, and clustering reduces the range around this difference. The methods presented here out perform the flat profile (akin to current methods).},

To continue supplying electricity reliably into the future, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) need to better understand low voltage customers.

We demonstrate a method to create an energy demand profile for a small to medium enterprise (SME) without a smart meter based only on operational hours, mean daily use (from quarterly readings), and smart meter data from other SMEs. We cluster the smart meter data using a simple Gaussian mixture model, thereby providing five groups of customers easily identified by their mean daily use. A new meter is assigned a cluster and an electricity profile created. For comparison, a profile is also created when the smart meter data is not clustered. The average difference between the actual and predicted operational/non-operational power is less than 0.2kWh, and clustering reduces the range around this difference.

  abstract = {Building energy consumption prediction plays an important role in improving the energy utilization rate through helping building managers to make better decisions. However, as a result of randomness and noisy disturbance, it is not an easy task to realize accurate prediction of the building energy consumption. In order to obtain better building energy consumption prediction accuracy, an extreme deep learning approach is presented in this paper. The proposed approach combines stacked autoencoders (SAEs) with the extreme learning machine (ELM) to take advantage of their respective characteristics. In this proposed approach, the SAE is used to extract the building energy consumption features, while the ELM is utilized as a predictor to obtain accurate prediction results. To determine the input variables of the extreme deep learning model, the partial autocorrelation analysis method is adopted. Additionally, in order to examine the performances of the proposed approach, it is compared with some popular machine learning methods, such as the backward propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), the generalized radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the best prediction performance in different cases of the building energy consumption.},

In this paper, an alternative approach, namely, hybrid genetic algorithm-adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (GA-ANFIS) is presented. In this model, GA optimizes the subtractive clustering's radiuses which help form the rule base, and ANFIS adjusts the premise and consequent parameters to optimize the forecasting performance. a hierarchical structure of ANFIS is also suggested to solve the probably curse-of-dimensionality problem. The performance of the proposed model is compared with ANN using two different data sets, which are collected from the Energy Prediction Shootout I contest and a library building located in Zhejiang University, China. Results show that the hybrid GA-ANFIS model has better performance than ANN in term of prediction accuracy. The proposed model also has the same scale of modeling time as ANN if parameters in GA procedure are carefully selected. It can be regarded as an alternative method in building energy prediction.},

In this paper we explore this problem for a class of architectures called NARX networks, which have powerful representational capabilities. Previous work reported that gradient descent learning is more effective in NARX networks than in recurrent networks with "hidden states". We show that although NARX networks do not circumvent the problem of long-term dependencies, they can greatly improve performance on such problems. We present some experimental 'results that show that NARX networks can often retain information for two to three times as long as conventional recurrent networks.},

  abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a selfcontained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead market of a microgrid consisting of intermittent distributed generation (DG), storage, dispatchable DG, and price responsive loads. The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components, and trades electricity in both day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, and day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed-integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator, a battery, and a responsive load show the advantage of stochastic optimization, as well as robust optimization.},

In this paper, we discuss some widelyused deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted.

  abstract = {Concept drift describes unforeseeable changes in the underlying distribution of streaming data over time. Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed. To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift. Also, concept drift related research directions are covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers in their understanding of research developments in the field of learning under concept drift.},

Non-linear regression using `neural networks' is a popular technique for such modeling tasks. Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many possible input variables, some of which may actually be irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a finite data set will show random correlations between the irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural network (even with regularisation or `weight decay') will not set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance.},

  abstract = {Efficient and effective city planning in improving the energy performance of residential buildings requires a clear understanding of the influential features. Previous studies on modeling the relationships between influential features and the energy consumption have several gaps and limitations, such as the linear modeling methodology and insufficient consideration of particular features. This study therefore aims at investigating the influence of 171 possibly related features on the regional energy use intensity (EUI) of residential buildings using a non-linear regression algorithm, namely Random Forests (RF). The New York City (NYC) was focused on due to data availability. The 171 features covered seven different aspects, which are building, economy, education, environment, households, surrounding, and transportation. The average site EUI of the residential buildings in each Block Group (BG) was set as the dependent variable. The regression model was compared to the models using typical linear methods, such as Multiple Linear Regression and Lasso. The results show that the RF model achieved a lower mean square error. In addition, the top 20 influential features were identified based on the out-of-bag estimation in RF. Results show that less percentage of well-educated people, higher percentage of households heated by fuel oil, lower household income and more residential complaints per capita are correlated with higher average site EUI in NYC. Related suggestions on improving the energy performance in different regions are presented to the local government.},

  abstract = {A focal point of ongoing research is matching the energy demand in the built environment to the energy supply from onsite generation, to maximize the self-consumption, and from the energy grids, to lower energy costs and reduce peak loads on the system. Energy flexibility addresses this task by modulating the energy demand in a building according to dynamic criteria such as electricity prices or onsite generation. This study addresses the potential of building performance simulation with real time rule-based control that provides energy flexibility based on onsite generation and hourly electricity prices, prioritizing energy matching, and reducing costs. The novelty relies on investigating four sources of energy flexibility simultaneously: shiftable machine loads, charging/discharging of batteries, hot-water storage tanks, and the building's mass. The energy matching and flexibility actions provided a decrease of up to 4\% in annual energy costs, yet risk increasing the cost by 9\% when the savings are offset by the increase in the energy demand. As well, the method for price categorization strongly influences the cost performance of the flexibility actions. The outcomes of this study provide insight to energy flexibility sources in nearly-zero energy buildings and how their outcomes are affected by price thresholds.},

  abstract = {Future electricity network must be flexible, accessible, reliable and economically viable to realise the aims of the smart grid initiative. In order to achieve these objectives and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, research on various configurations or architectures of microgrid (mGrid) systems is gaining greater attention. This is occurring in step with increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar, wind and other micro-sources. Energy storage can also be a part of the mGrid architecture to ensure more stable and sustainable operation. The techno-economic viability of the mGrid system is also a point of concern. Again, the variable and uncontrollable behaviour of RES can also introduce power quality problems. To improve the systems reliability, efficiency and power quality, different mGrid architectures are introduced. Complex control of the mGrid controller is helping to overcome these conditions. In that case, integration of Custom Power Devices is also playing an important role. Therefore, mGrid policies should also deal with these issues in the light of future trends towards the Smart Grid. This paper presents a literature review, based on various existing and/or simulated mGrid architectures. In relation to the reliability, efficiency and power quality issues, different distribution systems have been introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of these configurations are discussed here. The benefits of RES and its associated power quality problems have been identified. The benefits of energy storage systems and the development of communication systems towards the stable, flexible and efficient operation of smart grids are also reviewed. Findings have been outlined and then the policies with future trends of mGrid are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Building energy data has been used for decades to understand energy flows in buildings and plan for future energy demand. Recent market, technology and policy drivers have resulted in widespread data collection by stakeholders across the buildings industry. Consolidation of independently collected and maintained datasets presents a cost-effective opportunity to build a database of unprecedented size. Applications of the data include peer group analysis to evaluate building performance, and data-driven algorithms that use empirical data to estimate energy savings associated with building retrofits. This paper discusses technical considerations in compiling such a database using the DOE Buildings Performance Database (BPD) as a case study. We gathered data on over 750,000 residential and commercial buildings. We describe the process and challenges of mapping and cleansing data from disparate sources. We analyze the distributions of buildings in the BPD relative to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), evaluating peer groups of buildings that are well or poorly represented, and discussing how differences in the distributions of the three datasets impact use-cases of the data. Finally, we discuss the usefulness and limitations of the current dataset and the outlook for increasing its size and applications.},

This problem involves the performance of an adequate management of the energy demand, combining both convectional and renewable sources. To this end, the use of control strategies is an important tool. These control strategies can take advantage of knowledge of variables that act as disturbances in the closed loop scheme. Thus, it is of great importance the development of predictions of such variables. The main objective of this paper is to develop and assess a short-term predictive neural network model of the electricity demand for the CIESOL bioclimatic building, located in the southeast of Spain. The performed experiments show a quick prediction with acceptable final results for real data with a shortterm prediction horizon equal to 60 min and with a mean error of 11.48\%. One-step ahead predictions and dynamic modeling simulations have also been evaluated.},

  abstract = {The curse of dimensionality causes well-known and widely discussed problems for machine learning methods. There is a hypothesis that usage of Manhattan distance and even fractional quasinorms lp (for p less than 1) can help to overcome the curse of dimensionality in classification problems. In this study, we systematically test this hypothesis for 37 binary classification problems on 25 databases. We confirm that fractional quasinorms have greater relative contrast or coefficient of variation than Euclidean norm l2, but we demonstrate also that the distance concentration shows qualitatively the same behaviour for all tested norms and quasinorms and the difference between them decays while dimension tends to infinity. Estimation of classification quality for kNN based on different norms and quasinorms shows that the greater relative contrast does not mean the better classifier performance and the worst performance for different databases was shown by the different norms (quasinorms). A systematic comparison shows that the difference in performance of kNN based on lp for p=2, 1, and 0.5 is statistically insignificant.},

  abstract = {Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) are rich probabilistic models that have recently been applied to a wide range of problems, including collaborative filtering, classification, and modeling motion capture data. While much progress has been made in training non-conditional RBMs, these algorithms are not applicable to conditional models and there has been almost no work on training and generating predictions from conditional RBMs for structured output problems. We first argue that standard Contrastive Divergence-based learning may not be suitable for training CRBMs. We then identify two distinct types of structured output prediction problems and propose an improved learning algorithm for each. The first problem type is one where the output space has arbitrary structure but the set of likely output configurations is relatively small, such as in multi-label classification. The second problem is one where the output space is arbitrarily structured but where the output space variability is much greater, such as in image denoising or pixel labeling. We show that the new learning algorithms can work much better than Contrastive Divergence on both types of problems.},

  abstract = {Prediction of building energy consumption plays an important role in energy conservation, management, and planning. Continuously improving and enhancing the performance of forecasting models is the key to ensuring the performance sustainability of energy systems. In this connection, the current paper presented a new improved hybrid model of machine learning application for forecasting the cooling load (CL) and the heating load (HL) of residential buildings after studying and analyzing various types of CL and HL forecasting models. The proposed hybrid model, called group support vector regression (GSVR), is a combination of group method of data handling (GMDH) and support vector regression (SVR) models. To forecast CL and HL, this study also made use of base methods such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN), elastic-net regression (ENR), general regression neural network (GRNN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), partial least squares regression (PLSR), GMDH, and SVR. The technical parameters of the building were utilized as input variables of the forecasting models, and the CL and HL were adopted as the output variables of each network. All models were saved in the form of black box after training and initial testing. Finally, comparative analysis was performed to assess the predictive performance of the suggested model and the well-known basic models. Based on the results, the proposed hybrid method with high correlation coefficient (R) (e.g. R=99.92\% for CL forecasting and R=99.99\% for HL forecasting) and minimal statistical error values provided the most optimal prediction performance.},

  abstract = {Increasing complexity of power grids, growing demand, and requirement for greater reliability, security and efficiency as well as environmental and energy sustainability concerns continue to highlight the need for a quantum leap in harnessing communication and information technologies. This leap toward a ``smarter'' grid is widely referred to as ``smart grid.'' A framework for cohesive integration of these technologies facilitates convergence of acutely needed standards, and implementation of necessary analytical capabilities. This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response, and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges further. A gridwide IT architectural framework is presented to meet these challenges while facilitating modern cybersecurity measures. This architecture supports a multitude of geographically and temporally coordinated hierarchical monitoring and control actions over time scales from milliseconds and up.},

The proposed optimization framework aims to balance between maximizing the expected benefit of the MG in the deregulated electricity market and minimizing the MG operation cost considering users' thermal comfort requirements and other system constraints. The power scheduling and bidding problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program where various system uncertainties are captured by using the Monte Carlo simulation approach. Our formulation is novel in that it can exploit the thermal dynamic characteristics of buildings to compensate for the variable and intermittent nature of renewable energy resources and enables us to achieve desirable tradeoffs for different conflicting design objectives. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the great benefits in exploiting the building thermal dynamics and the flexibility of the proposed scheduling method in achieving different practical design tradeoffs. We also investigate the impacts of different design and system parameters on the curtailment of renewable energy resources and the optimal expected profit of the MG.},

In addition to knowledge regarding the technical characteristics of smart grids, we need to know what drives companies and consumers to sell and purchase services in a smart grid. This paper reviews 45 scientific articles on business models for smart grid services and analyses information on value in 434 European and US smart grid pilot projects. Our review observes that the articles and pilots most often discuss three types of smart grid services: vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle services, demand response services, and services to integrate renewable energy (RE). We offer a classification of business models, value creation and capture for each of these services and for the different actors in the electricity value chain. Although business models have been developed for grid-to-vehicle services and for services that connect RE, knowledge regarding demand response services is restricted to different types of value creation and capture. Our results highlight that business models can be profitable when a new actor in the electricity industry, that is, the aggregator, can collect sufficiently large amounts of load. In addition, our analysis indicates that demand response services or vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle services will be offered in conjunction with the supply of RE.},

Each of these two solutions has its own special significance and may be employed for different purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to assess and review papers and literature in this field. In this paper, the scheduling problem of DERs is studied from various aspects such as modeling techniques, solving methods, reliability, emission, uncertainty, stability, demand response (DR), and multi-objective standpoint in the microgrid and VPP frameworks.

However, finding an appropriated method to deal with time series normalization is not a simple task. This is because most of the traditional normalization methods make assumptions that do not hold for most time series. The first assumption is that all time series are stationary, i.e., their statistical properties, such as mean and standard deviation, do not change over time. The second assumption is that the volatility of the time series is considered uniform. None of the methods currently available in the literature address these issues. This paper proposes a new method for normalizing non-stationary heteroscedastic (with non-uniform volatility) time series. The method, named Adaptive Normalization (AN), was tested together with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in three forecast problems. The results were compared to other four traditional normalization methods, and showed AN improves ANN accuracy in both short- and long-term predictions.},

The high penetration of distributed energy resources introduces new flexibility services like prosumer or community self-balancing, congestion management and time-of-use optimization. This work is focused on the flexibility framework to enable multiple participants to compete for selling or buying flexibility. In this framework, the aggregator acts as a local market operator and supervises flexibility transactions of the local energy community. Local market participation is voluntary. Potential flexibility stakeholders are the distribution system operator, the balance responsible party and end-users themselves. Flexibility is sold by means of loads, generators, storage units and electric vehicles. Finally, this paper presents needed interactions between all local market stakeholders, the corresponding inputs and outputs of local market operation algorithms from participants and a case study to highlight the application of the local flexibility market in three scenarios. The local market framework could postpone grid upgrades, reduce energy costs and increase distribution grids' hosting capacity.},

This study describes a statisticalanalysis of the performance of different models used to calculate thebaseline electric load for commercial buildings participating in ademand-response (DR) program, with emphasis onthe importance of weathereffects. During a DR event, a variety of adjustments may be made tobuilding operation, with the goal of reducing the building peak electricload. In order to determine the actual peak load reduction, an estimateof what the load would have been on the day of the event without any DRactions is needed. This baseline load profile (BLP) is key to accuratelyassessing the load impacts from event-based DR programs and may alsoimpact payment settlements for certain types of DR programs. We testedseven baseline models on a sample of 33 buildings located in California.These models can be loosely categorized into two groups: (1) averagingmethods, which use some linear combination of hourly load values fromprevious days to predict the load on the event, and (2) explicit weathermodels, which use a formula based on local hourly temperature to predictthe load. The models were tested both with and without morningadjustments, which use data from the day of the event to adjust theestimated BLP up or down.Key findings from this study are: - The accuracyof the BLP model currently used by California utilities to estimate loadreductions in several DR programs (i.e., hourly usage in highest 3 out of10 previous days) could be improved substantially if a morning adjustmentfactor were applied for weather-sensitive commercial and institutionalbuildings. - Applying a morning adjustment factor significantly reducesthe bias and improves the accuracy of all BLP models examined in oursample of buildings. - For buildings with low load variability, all BLPmodels perform reasonably well in accuracy. - For customer accounts withhighly variable loads, we found that no BLP model produced satisfactoryresults, although averaging methods perform best in accuracy (but notbias). These types of customers are difficult to characterize withstandard BLP models that rely on historic loads and weather data.Implications of these results for DR program administrators andpolicymakersare: - Most DR programs apply similar DR BLP methods tocommercial and industrial sector customers. The results of our study whencombined with other recent studies (Quantum 2004 and 2006, Buege et al.,2006) suggests that DR program administrators should have flexibility andmultiple options for suggesting the most appropriate BLP method forspecific types of customers.},

  abstract = {The development of distribution networks for participation in active network management (ANM) and smart grids is introduced using the microgrid concept. In recent years, this issue has been researched and implemented by many experts. The second part of this paper describes those developed operational concepts of microgrids that have an impact on their participation in ANM and in the requirements for achieving targets. Power quality is the most challenging task in microgrids, especially when the system switches from normal parallel operation (grid-connected mode) to island operation. Indeed, following planned or unplanned transitions to island mode, microgrids may develop instability. For this reason, the paper addresses the principles behind island-detection methods, black-start operation, fault management, and protection systems, along with a comprehensive review of power quality. Finally, island detection and the other topics are summarized with a flowchart and tables.},

The prediction is performed by means of a weighted average of past daily load segments, the shape of which is similar to the expected shape of the load segment to be predicted. The past load segments are identified from the available history of the observed load segments by means of their closeness to a so-called reference load segment. The latter is selected in a manner that captures the expected qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the load segment to be predicted. As an illustration, the suggested functional time-series forecasting methodology is applied to historical daily load data in Cyprus. Its performance is compared with some recently proposed alternative methodologies for short-term load forecasting.},

We analyse this question at a number of levels and show that the answer is different at each of them. As our first main observation, we show the consistency of a k approximate nearest neighbour classifier. However, the performance of the classifier in very high dimensions is provably unstable. As our second main observation, we point out that the existing model for statistical learning is oblivious of dimension of the domain and so every learning problem admits a universally consistent deterministic reduction to the one-dimensional case by means of a Borel isomorphism.},

In order to devise the forecasting solutions, we have developed a series of dynamic neural networks for solving nonlinear time series problems, based on the non-linear autoregressive (NAR) and non-linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) models. In both cases, we have used large datasets comprising the hourly energy consumption recorded by the smart metering device from a commercial center type of consumer (a large hypermarket), while in the NARX case we have used supplementary temperature and time stamps datasets. Of particular interest was to research and obtain an optimal mix between the training algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization, Scaled Conjugate Gradient), the hidden number of neurons and the delay parameter. Using performance metrics and forecasting scenarios, we have obtained results that highlight an increased accuracy of the developed forecasting solutions. The developed hourly consumption forecasting solutions can bring significant benefits to both the consumers and electricity suppliers.},

Herein, we study the adequacy of plain-designed non-linear models to predict energy consumption in a real-world Intelligent Building setting by using simple predictor variables such as time-of-day, weather conditions, and occupancy as estimated from WiFi traffic. The developed Fuzzy Systems and Neural Network models achieve considerably better performance and accuracy indexes than linear regression models, with VAFs equal to 79.3\% and 75.7\% respectively, and MAE of 5.9 and 7.1 kWh, respectively, against 36.6\% VAF and 12.8 kWh MAE for linear regression models, thus demonstrating that low complexity non-linear models can be used to accurately describe energy consumption baselines in Intelligent Buildings.},

  abstract = {We study regression estimation when the explanatory variable is functional. Nonparametric estimates of the regression operator have been recently introduced. They depend on a smoothing factor which controls its behavior, and the aim of our work is to construct some data-driven criterion for choosing this smoothing parameter. The criterion can be formulated in terms of a functional version of cross-validation ideas. Under mild assumptions on the unknown regression operator, it is seen that this rule is asymptotically optimal. As by-products of this result, we state some asymptotic equivalences for several measures of accuracy for nonparametric estimate of the regression operator. We also present general inequalities for bounding moments of random sums involving functional variables. Finally, a short simulation study is carried out to illustrate the behavior of our method for finite samples.},

It is shown that h-block cross-validation is inconsistent in the sense of Shao (1993, Journal of American Statistical Association 88(422), 486\vphantom\{\}495) and therefore is not asymptotically optimal. A modi"cation of the h-block method, dubbed \&hv-block' cross-validation, is proposed which is asymptotically optimal. The proposed approach is consistent for general stationary observations in the sense that the probability of selecting the model with the best predictive ability converges to 1 as the total number of observations approaches in"nity.

  abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of {$\geqslant$}1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

Functional data analysis involves infinite dimensional processes and/or data. The paper shows how the theory of L-splines can support generalizations of linear modelling and principal components analysis to samples drawn from random functions. Spline smoothing rests on a partition of a function space into two orthogonal subspaces, one of which contains the obvious or structural components of variation among a set of observed functions, and the other of which contains residual components. This partitioning is achieved through the use of a linear differential operator, and we show how the theory of polynomial splines can be applied more generally with an arbitrary operator and associated boundary constraints. These data analysis tools are illustrated by a study of variation in temperature-precipitation patterns among some Canadian weather-stations.},

In this research for Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) it has been used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and, despite the consumption unpredictability, it has been shown the possibility to forecast the electricity consumption of a household with certainty. The ANNs are recognized to be a potential methodology for modeling hourly and daily energy consumption and load forecasting. Input variables such as apartment area, numbers of occupants, electrical appliance consumption and Boolean inputs as hourly meter system were considered. Furthermore, the investigation carried out aims to define an ANN architecture and a training algorithm in order to achieve a robust model to be used in forecasting energy consumption in a typical household. It was observed that a feed-forward ANN and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided a good performance. For this research it was used a database with consumption records, logged in 93 real households, in Lisbon, Portugal, between February 2000 and July 2001, including both weekdays and weekend. The results show that the ANN approach provides a reliable model for forecasting household electric energy consumption and load profile.},

Therefore, increasing our energy efficiency is of great importance in order to achieve overall sustainability. Forecasting the building energy consumption is important for a wide variety of applications including planning, management, optimization, and conservation. Data-driven models for energy forecasting have grown significantly within the past few decades due to their increased performance, robustness and ease of deployment. Amongst the many different types of models, artificial neural networks rank among the most popular data-driven approaches applied to date. This paper offers a review of the studies published since the year 2000 which have applied artificial neural networks for forecasting building energy use and demand, with a particular focus on reviewing the applications, data, forecasting models, and performance metrics used in model evaluations. Based on this review, existing research gaps are identified and presented. Finally, future research directions in the area of artificial neural networks for building energy forecasting are highlighted.},

However, the importance of demand side energy management, including individual load forecasting, is becoming critical. In this paper, we propose deep neural network (DNN)-based load forecasting models and apply them to a demand side empirical load database. DNNs are trained in two different ways: a pre-training restricted Boltzmann machine and using the rectified linear unit without pre-training. DNN forecasting models are trained by individual customer's electricity consumption data and regional meteorological elements. To verify the performance of DNNs, forecasting results are compared with a shallow neural network (SNN), a double seasonal Holt\textendash Winters (DSHW) model and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) are used for verification. Our results show that DNNs exhibit accurate and robust predictions compared to other forecasting models, e.g., MAPE and RRMSE are reduced by up to 17\% and 22\% compared to SNN and 9\% and 29\% compared to DSHW.},

Predictive modeling approaches that define and validate models with independent datasets offer a solution to this problem. While these methods can detect novel and generalizable brain-behavior associations, they can be daunting, which has limited their use by the wider connectivity community. Here, we offer practical advice and examples based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data for implementing these approaches. We hope these ten rules will increase the use of predictive models with neuroimaging data.},

It is found that these selection procedures can be classified into three classes according to their asymptotic behavior. Under some fairly weak conditions, the selection procedures in one class are asymptotically valid if there exist fixed-dimension correct models; the selection procedures in another class are asymptotically valid if no fixed-dimension correct model exists. The procedures in the third class are compromises of the procedures in the first two classes. Some empirical results are also presented.},

  abstract = {Electricity consumption data is regarded as nonlinear, non-stationary series, and is often made up by a superposition of several distinct frequencies. Thus most of the conventional approaches currently employed for the modeling and forecasting involve great complexity and uncertainty. Recently, fluctuation characteristic analysis has increasingly become essential step in the application of electricity demand forecasting, yet the implementation of this analysis is an inherently difficult task. To obtain reasonable accuracy and stability in the modeling, there has been the tendency to accommodate multidimensional attributes of the consumption demands with decomposition based approach in terms of more advanced and hybrid form. And the decomposition can be achieved through utilization of two different procedures, namely component modelbased and frequency domain analysis-based decomposition. Consequently, a comprehensive review and summarization of decomposition based approach for the prediction is conducted in this paper. More specifically, the issues of demand forecasting classification, the dependency between the electricity demand and external indicators, features of various decomposition approach, as well as the unique fluctuation characteristic of electricity demand at different time scales are discussed. In addition, future research directions of the decomposition based prediction approach are outlined.},

  abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms\textemdash deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5\%, SVR by 13.1\% and classical deep RNN by 6.5\% in terms of RMSE.},

On the other hand, an office building generally consists of several types of rooms, i.e., office rooms, computer rooms, storage rooms, meeting rooms, etc., the energy consumption of which varies in accordance with different working routines in each type of rooms. In this paper, several novel reservoir topologies of ESNs are developed, the performance of ESNs with different reservoir topologies in predicting the energy consumption of rooms in the office building is compared, and the energy consumption of all the rooms in the office building is predicted with the developed topologies. Moreover, parameter sensitivity of ESNs with different reservoir topologies is analyzed. A case study shows that the developed simplified reservoir topologies are sufficient to achieve outstanding performance of ESNs in the prediction of building energy consumption.},

Over the years, numerous studies have based their conclusions on such datasets, with mis-performing methods being unlikely to receive any further attention. However, it has been reported that these datasets might not be indicative, as they display many limitations. Since forecasting research is driven somewhat by data from forecasting competitions, it becomes vital to determine whether they are indeed representative of the reality or whether forecasters tend to over-fit their methods on a random sample of series. This paper uses the data from M4 as proportionate to the real world and compares its properties with those of past datasets commonly used in the literature as benchmarks in order to provide evidence on that question. The results show that many popular benchmarks of the past may indeed deviate from reality, and ways forward are discussed in response.},

Under covariate shift, standard learning methods such as maximum likelihood estimation are no longer consistent\textemdash weighted variants according to the ratio of test and training input densities are consistent. Therefore, accurately estimating the density ratio, called the importance, is one of the key issues in covariate shift adaptation. A naive approach to this task is to first estimate training and test input densities separately and then estimate the importance by taking the ratio of the estimated densities. However, this naive approach tends to perform poorly since density estimation is a hard task particularly in high dimensional cases. In this paper, we propose a direct importance estimation method that does not involve density estimation. Our method is equipped with a natural cross validation procedure and hence tuning parameters such as the kernel width can be objectively optimized. Simulations illustrate the usefulness of our approach.},

However, regression analysis is not sufficiently informative if the conditional distribution has multi-modality, is highly asymmetric, or contains heteroscedastic noise. In such scenarios, estimating the conditional distribution itself would be more useful. In this paper, we propose a novel method of conditional density estimation that is suitable for multi-dimensional continuous variables. The basic idea of the proposed method is to express the conditional density in terms of the density ratio and the ratio is directly estimated without going through density estimation. Experiments using benchmark and robot transition datasets illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Smart electricity meters are currently deployed in millions of households to collect detailed individual electricity consumption data. Compared with traditional electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future electricity demand in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and distribution. We propose to estimate an additive quantile regression model for a set of quantiles of the future distribution using a boosting procedure. By doing so, we can benefit from flexible and interpretable models, which include an automatic variable selection. We compare our approach with three benchmark methods on both aggregated and disaggregated scales using a smart meter data set collected from 3639 households in Ireland at 30-min intervals over a period of 1.5 years. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach based on quantile regression provides better forecast accuracy for disaggregated demand, while the traditional approach based on a normality assumption (possibly after an appropriate Box-Cox transformation) is a better approximation for aggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.},

  abstract = {Electricity smart meters record consumption, on a near real-time basis, at the level of individual commercial and residential properties. From this, a hierarchy can be constructed consisting of time series of demand at the smart meter level, and at various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities and regions. Forecasts are needed at each level to support the efficient and reliable management of consumption. A limitation of previous research in this area is that it considered only deterministic prediction. To enable improved decision-making, we introduce an algorithm for producing a probability density forecast for each series within a large-scale hierarchy. The resulting forecasts are coherent in the sense that the forecast distribution of each aggregate series is equal to the convolution of the forecast distributions of the corresponding disaggregate series. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through forecast combination. Distributional assumptions are not required, and dependencies between forecast distributions are imposed through the use of empirical copulas. Scalability to large hierarchies is enabled by decomposing the problem into multiple lower-dimension sub-problems.

  abstract = {We propose a new forecasting strategy, called rectify, that seeks to combine the best properties of both the recursive and direct forecasting strategies. The rationale behind the rectify strategy is to begin with biased recursive forecasts and adjust them so they are unbiased and have smaller error. We use linear and nonlinear simulated time series to investigate the performance of the rectify strategy and compare the results with those from the recursive and the direct strategies. We also carry out some experiments using real world time series from the M3 and the NN5 forecasting competitions. We find that the rectify strategy is always better than, or at least has comparable performance to, the best of the recursive and the direct strategies. This finding makes the rectify strategy very attractive as it avoids making a choice between the recursive and the direct strategies which can be a difficult task in real-world applications.},

These curves can often be viewed as realizations of a composite process driven by both amplitude and time variation. We consider the situation where functional variation is dominated by time variation, and develop a curve-synchronization method that uses every trajectory in the sample as a reference to obtain pairwise warping functions in a first step. These initial pairwise warping functions are then used to create improved estimators of the underlying individual warping functions in a second step. A truncated averaging process is used to obtain robust estimation of individual warping functions. The method compares well with other available warping approaches and is illustrated with Berkeley growth data and gene expression data for multiple sclerosis.},

The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. This ``conditional'' RBM (CRBM) makes on-line inference efficient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various sequences from a model trained on motion capture data and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during capture.},

A new hypothesis is proposed for organizing the synapse from x to y neuron. The synapse of number of neurons to fire between the hidden layer is identified. By the introduction of this hypothesis, an effective number of neurons in multilayered Artificial Neural Network can be identified and self organizing neural network model is developed which is referred as cognitron. The normal brain model has 3 layered perceptron; but the proposed model organizes the number of layers optimal for identifying an effective model. Our result proved that the proposed model constructs a neural model directly by identifying the optimal weights of each neurons and number of neurons in each dynamically identified hidden layers. This optimized model is self organized with different range of neurons on different layer of hidden layer, and by comparing the performance based on computational time and error at each iteration. An efficient number of neurons are organized using gradient decent. The proposed model thus train large model to perform the classification task by inserting optimal layers and neurons.},

The main argument is on whether one should use the Integrated Squared Error or the Mean Integrated Squared Error to de ne the optimal bandwidth. In the last years a lot of research was done to develop bandwidth selection methods which try to estimate the optimal bandwidth obtained by either of this error criterion. This paper summarizes the most important arguments for each criterion and gives an overview over the existing bandwidth selection methods. We also summarize the small sample behaviour of these methods as assessed in several Monte\{Carlo studies. These Monte\{Carlo studies are all restricted to very small sample sizes due to the fact that the numerical e ort of estimating the optimal bandwidth by any of these bandwidth selection methods is proportional to the square of the sample size. This high computational cost for estimating the optimal bandwidth can be signi cantly reduced by binning or discretization methods. These methods will be explained and it will be shown how the presented bandwidth selectors can be implemented in a much faster way.\vphantom{\}\}\}}},

Historic time series of loads and consumption data of \O stfold University College in Halden have been used for seeding and tested for trends, seasonality, cyclic characteristics and randomness. Accuracy for all three methods are fair and can be applied for the purpose. Priority is placed on ARIMA due to its transparency. This provides a simple form of explanation. The next hour predictions obtained will yield sufficient information and latitude to change operational strategies and move loads or substitute imported electricity with energy produced from local resources.},

  abstract = {Background: Functional data analysis (FDA) is increasingly being used to better analyze, model and predict time series data. Key aspects of FDA include the choice of smoothing technique, data reduction, adjustment for clustering, functional linear modeling and forecasting methods. Methods: A systematic review using 11 electronic databases was conducted to identify FDA application studies published in the peer-review literature during 1995\textendash 2010. Papers reporting methodological considerations only were excluded, as were non-English articles. Results: In total, 84 FDA application articles were identified; 75.0\% of the reviewed articles have been published since 2005. Application of FDA has appeared in a large number of publications across various fields of sciences; the majority is related to biomedicine applications (21.4\%). Overall, 72 studies (85.7\%) provided information about the type of smoothing techniques used, with B-spline smoothing (29.8\%) being the most popular. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for extracting information from functional data was reported in 51 (60.7\%) studies. One-quarter (25.0\%) of the published studies used functional linear models to describe relationships between explanatory and outcome variables and only 8.3\% used FDA for forecasting time series data. Conclusions: Despite its clear benefits for analyzing time series data, full appreciation of the key features and value of FDA have been limited to date, though the applications show its relevance to many public health and biomedical problems. Wider application of FDA to all studies involving correlated measurements should allow better modeling of, and predictions from, such data in the future especially as FDA makes no a priori age and time effects assumptions.},

  abstract = {The deployment of traditional computing, control and monitoring paradigms in modern smart grids is characterized by several severe limitations. These could restrict their capability to manage the huge complexities and the vast penetration of distributed and renewable energy resources that are expected in future operational scenarios. In this context, the design of more scalable and more flexible solution paradigms represents a relevant issue to address. The enabling technologies and methodologies aimed at addressing these complex challenges include decentralized computing, self-organizing sensor networks, proactive control, and holistic computing frameworks. Accordingly, in this paper a selection from literature published on these topics will be analyzed and reviewed, in order to outline the most relevant research trends, and the main open problems.},

Various data-driven models can be effective predicting specific time series one-step-ahead. The aim of this work is to investigate the adequacy of neural network methodology for predicting the entire load curve day-ahead and evaluate its performance for a wide-scale application on local loads. To do so, we adopt networks from other short-term load forecasting problems for the multi-step prediction. We evaluate various feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures drawing statistically relevant conclusions on a large sample of residential buildings. Our results suggest that neural network methodology might be ill-chosen when we predict numerous loads of different characteristics while manual setup is not possible. This article urges to consider other techniques that aim to substitute standardized load profiles using wide-scale smart meters data.},

With the increasing share of decentralized supply connected to the distribution grid, balancing of supply and demand will have to be done locally, at the low-voltage level, for which short term load forecast becomes indispensable. At the same time, forecasting techniques based on standardized or individual load profiles, commonly used in the distribution grid, are inadequate for disaggregated loads. In this publication, we investigate the K-Nearest Neighbors approach that we have proposed earlier for the low voltage load forecasting. We focus on various model design decisions such as parametrization scheme, the choice of a distance notion and combination function aiming to further improve the model. We use it to forecast the load of 600 consumers of different types showing how different model designs can substantially improve the forecast accuracy.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of predictive models is a ubiquitous task in machine learning and data mining. Cross-validation is often used as a means for evaluating models. There appears to be some confusion among researchers, however, about best practices for cross-validation, and about the interpretation of cross-validation results. In particular, repeated cross-validation is often advocated, and so is the reporting of standard deviations, confidence intervals, or an indication of ''significance''. In this paper, we argue that, under many practical circumstances, when the goal of the experiments is to see how well the model returned by a learner will perform in practice in a particular domain, repeated cross-validation is not useful, and the reporting of confidence intervals or significance is misleading. Our arguments are supported by experimental results.},

High-dimensional spaces show surprising, counter-intuitive geometrical properties that have a large influence on the performances of data analysis tools. Among these properties, the concentration of the norm phenomenon results in the fact that Euclidean norms and Gaussian kernels, both commonly used in models, become inappropriate in high-dimensional spaces. This papers presents alternative distance measures and kernels, together with geometrical methods to decrease the dimension of the space. The methodology is applied to a typical time series prediction example.},

  abstract = {The problem of predicting a future value of a time series is considered in this paper. If the series follows a stationary Markov process, this can be done by nonparametric estimation of the autoregression function. Two forecasting algorithms are introduced. They only differ in the nonparametric kernel-type estimator used: the Nadaraya-Watson estimator and the local linear estimator. There are three major issues in the implementation of these algorithms: selection of the autoregressor variables; smoothing parameter selection and computing prediction intervals. These have been tackled using recent techniques borrowed from the nonparametric regression estimation literature under dependence. The performance of these nonparametric algorithms has been studied by applying them to a collection of 43 well-known time series. Their results have been compared to those obtained using classical Box-Jenkins methods. Finally, the practical behaviour of the methods is also illustrated by a detailed analysis of two data sets.},

  abstract = {Distributed renewable energy, particularly photovoltaics (PV), has expanded rapidly over the past decade. Distributed PV is located behind the meter and is, thus, invisible to the retailers and the distribution system operator. This invisible generation, thus, injects additional uncertainty in the net load and makes it harder to forecast. This paper proposes a data-driven probabilistic net load forecasting method specifically designed to handle a high penetration of behind-the-meter (BtM) PV. The capacity of BtM PV is first estimated using a maximal information coefficient based correlation analysis and a grid search. The net load profile is then decomposed into three parts (PV output, actual load, and residual) which are forecast individually. Correlation analysis based on copula theory is conducted on the distributions and dependencies of the forecasting errors to generate a probabilistic net load forecast. Case studies based on ISO New England data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches, particularly when the penetration of BtM PV is high.},

  abstract = {Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AIbased approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.},

Meanwhile, the deregulation of the power industry, particularly on the delivery side, has continuously been moving forward worldwide. How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.},

  abstract = {Electrical load time series are non-stationary and highly noisy because a variety of factors affect electrical markets. The direct forecasting of electrical load with noisy data is usually subject to large errors. This paper proposes a novel approach for short-term load forecasting (STLF) by applying wavelet de-noising in a combined model that is a hybrid of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) and neural networks. The process of the proposed approach first decomposes the historical data into an approximate part associated with low frequency and a detailed part associated with high frequencies via a wavelet transform. A SARIMA and a back propagation neural network (BPNN) are then established by the low-frequency signal to forecast the future value. Finally, the short-term load is forecasted by combining the prediction values of SARIMA and BPNN, and the weights of the combination are determined using a variance\textendash covariance approach. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the electricity load data in New South Wales, Australia, are used as an illustrative example. A comparison of the results with other models shows that the proposed model can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy.},

This article reviews the prevailing data-driven approaches used in building energy analysis under different archetypes and granularities, including those methods for prediction (artificial neural networks, support vector machines, statistical regression, decision tree and genetic algorithm) and those methods for classification (K-mean clustering, self-organizing map and hierarchy clustering). The review results demonstrate that the data-driven approaches have well addressed a large variety of building energy related applications, such as load forecasting and prediction, energy pattern profiling, regional energy-consumption mapping, benchmarking for building stocks, global retrofit strategies and guideline making etc. Significantly, this review refines a few key tasks for modification of the data-driven approaches in the context of application to building energy analysis. The conclusions drawn in this review could facilitate future micro-scale changes of energy use for a particular building through the appropriate retrofit and the inclusion of renewable energy technologies. It also paves an avenue to explore potential in macro-scale energy-reduction with consideration of customer demands. All these will be useful to establish a better long-term strategy for urban sustainability.},

The maximum sample size for any group shown in a figure was ten, with an interquartile range of nine (25th percentile: n = 6, 75th percentile: n = 15). Univariate scatterplots would be the best choice for many of these small studies. The summary statistics shown in bar graphs, line graphs, and box plots are only meaningful when there are enough data to summarize. Histograms are difficult to interpret when there aren't enough observations to clearly show the distribution of the data.},

  abstract = {Many learning situations involve learning the conditional distribution ppy|xq when the training instances are drawn from the training distribution ptrpxq, even though it will later be used to predict for instances drawn from a different test distribution ptepxq. Most current approaches focus on learning how to reweigh the training examples, to make them resemble the test distribution. However, reweighing does not always help, because (we show that) the test error also depends on the correctness of the underlying model class. This paper analyses this situation by viewing the problem of learning under changing distributions as a game between a learner and an adversary. We characterize when such reweighing is needed, and also provide an algorithm, robust covariate shift adjustment (RCSA), that provides relevant weights. Our empirical studies, on UCI datasets and a real-world cancer prognostic prediction dataset, show that our analysis applies, and that our RCSA works effectively.},

To get an understanding of the status quo of the research on blockchain-based energy exchange, we conducted a systematic literature review on the existing academic articles and industry projects. This article describes the design and technical specifications of the first real blockchain-based electricity market in Switzerland derived from this literature review and outlines the implementation of this market in the real world.

However, modeling energy consumption in traditional physic-modeling techniques remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present a data-mining-based methodology, as an alternative, for developing data-driven models to predict energy consumption for BEMSs. Following the methodology, we developed data-driven models for predicting energy consumption for a chiller in BEMS by using historic building operation data and weather forecast information. The models were evaluated with unseen data. The experimental results demonstrated that the data-driven models can predict energy consumption for chiller with promising accuracy.},

  abstract = {The emergence of smart grid technologies and applications has meant there is increasing interest in utilising smart meters. Smart meter penetration has significantly increased over the last decade and they are becoming more widespread globally. Companies such as Google, Nest, Intel, General Electric and Amazon are amongst those companies which have been developing end use applications such as home and battery energy management systems which leverage smart meter data. In addition, utilities and networks are becoming more aware of the potential benefits of using household smart meter data in demand side management strategies such as energy efficiency and demand response. Motivated by this fact, the amount of research in this area has grown considerably in recent years. This paper reviews the most recent methods and techniques for using smart meter data such as forecasting, clustering, classification and optimization. The study covers various applications such as Home and Battery Energy Management Systems and demand response strategies enabled by the analysis of smart meter data. From a comprehensive review of the literature, it was observed that there are remarkable discrepancies between the studies, which make in-depth comparison and analysis challenging. Data analysis and reporting guidelines are suggested for studies which use smart meter data. These guidelines could provide a consistent and common framework which could enhance future research.},

  abstract = {In order to coordinate the economic desire of microgrid (MG) owners and the stability operation requirement of the distribution system operator (DSO), a multi-market participation framework is proposed to stimulate the energy transaction potential of MGs through distributed and centralized ways. Firstly, an MG equipped with storage can contribute to the stability improvement at special nodes of the distribution grid where the uncertain factors (such as intermittent renewable sources and electric vehicles) exist. The DSO is thus interested in encouraging specified MGs to provide voltage stability services by creating a distribution grid service market (DGSM), where the dynamic production-price auction is used to capture the competition of the distributed MGs. Moreover, an aggregator, serving as a broker and controller for MGs, is considered to participate in the day-ahead wholesale market. A Stackelberg game is modeled accordingly to solve the price and quantity package allocation between aggregator and MGs. Finally, the modified IEEE-33 bus distribution test system is used to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed multi-market mechanism. The results under this framework improve both MGs and utility.},

  abstract = {With the gradual deployment of smart meters in many cities around the world, new opportunities arise in reducing energy usage and improving consumers' information and control on their electricity consumption. Central to the provision of these newer services is the ability to accurately forecast the electricity demand of individual households. Compared with load forecasting at the city level and larger system aggregates, load forecasting for individual households is a much harder problem as the loads are much more stochastic and volatile. In this paper, we study the use of sparse coding for modeling and forecasting these individual household electricity loads. The proposed methods are tested on a data set of 5000 households in a joint project with electric power board of Chattanooga, for the period from September 2011 to August 2013. We obtain 10\% improvements in the accuracy of forecasting next-day total load and next-week total load when we add sparse code features in ridge regression in this difficult problem. We also evaluate more classical forecasting methods on this forecasting problem, including autoregressive integrated moving average and Holt-Winters smoothing.},

Based on the classification, the detailed mathematical descriptions are summarized. And then, optimization objectives and constraints, which are adopted to improve the running performance of VPP with uncertainties, are summed up systematically. Solution approaches and tools for the optimization are also presented. At last, demonstration projects are introduced to show how uncertainties are handled in practice.

The characterizations of big data, smart grids as well as huge amount of data collection are firstly discussed as a prelude to illustrating the motivation and potential advantages of implementing advanced data analytics in smart grids. Basic concepts and the procedures of the typical data analytics for general problems are also discussed. The advanced applications of different data analytics in smart grids are addressed as the main part of this paper. By dealing with huge amount of data from electricity network, meteorological information system, geographical information system etc., many benefits can be brought to the existing power system and improve the customer service as well as the social welfare in the era of big data. However, to advance the applications of the big data analytics in real smart grids, many issues such as techniques, awareness, synergies, etc., have to be overcome.},

  abstract = {The building sector takes a large proportion of electricity consumption and carbon emission in high-density urban areas. To reduce the carbon emissions and use energy more efficiently in the building sector, home energy management system (HEMS) is proposed and used. In the HEMS, the prediction of electricity consumption in the short-term future is used to support the decision makings in the HEMS. Although there existed a number of studies in the prediction of electricity consumption in buildings, there lacks a spatial analysis in the prediction performance, especially on the appliance or sub-meter level and household level. The authors made an assumption that by the performance of household energy consumption prediction can be significantly improved if the prediction is aggregated from the prediction data at the appliance or sub-meter level. Next, two typical datasets are used to validate the assumption by comparing the prediction performance of aggregating the prediction data at appliance level and the one of making direct prediction at the household level. The models used for the prediction are standard stateful long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which have been proofed to be promising in load prediction by previous studies. The results from the comparison validated the assumption, showing that the prediction performance can be significantly improved if prediction is made at the appliance-level first and then aggregated to get the household-level prediction. Therefore, the authors conclude that prediction at the finer appliance granularity level can significantly improve the performance of household-level electricity prediction.},

  abstract = {Load prediction is an important tool for grid utilities and power companies for managing the power system. This has traditionally mainly been applied at transmission and subtransmission system levels. However, as the traditional grid evolves into a smart grid, load prediction at smaller scales becomes necessary for efficient management and operation. In this paper we investigate how the qualitative and statistical properties of load time series change as a function of the number of individual loads aggregated in the series, and how these properties influence the predictability of the time series. We study the performance of a traditional autoregressive model, a wavelet-based model, an Echo State Network, and a variation of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) at the subtransmission (\textasciitilde 10000 customers), distribution substation (\textasciitilde 150 customers) and single-meter level. For all the four prediction methods, we employ an evolutionary algorithm as a meta-learner to automatically optimize the free parameters for each model-dataset combination. We find that relatively accurate predictions can be made at finer granularity, but care must be taken in choosing, tuning and analyzing the prediction model as the regularity of the consumption patterns decreases.},

However, electric utilities nowadays obtain ever more precise information from single consumers connected to the low- and medium-voltage grid thanks to smart meters (SMs). This allows a previously unattainable degree of detail in state estimation and other grid analysis functionalities such as predictions. This paper focuses on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for accurate short-term load and Photovoltaic (PV) predictions of SM profiles and investigates different spatial aggregation levels. A concluding power flow analysis confirms the benefits of time series prediction to support grid operation. This study is based on the SM data available from more than 40,000 consumers as well as PV systems in the City of Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Short-term load forecasting is becoming popular in low-voltage grids due to the availability of Smart Meter (SM) measurements. At the individual customer level, load profiles are characterized by a high volatility and are hard to predict, i.e., traditional forecasting algorithms generally perform poorly. Furthermore, their evaluation based on point-wise metrics like the MAPE and RMSE give a biased image of the actual prediction accuracy. In this paper, we discuss the performance of four forecasting methods, including a novel algorithm based on Markov chains. We investigate different approaches to assess the forecast performance on volatile loads and we notably compare the statistical properties of the predictions. The analysis highlights the inadequacy of traditional point forecasting algorithms and standard point-wise metrics.},
